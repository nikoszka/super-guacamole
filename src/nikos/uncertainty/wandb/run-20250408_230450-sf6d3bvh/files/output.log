In his own writings Xenophon focused mostly on practical subjects or history, without showing much enthusiasm for philosophical speculations.

Xenophon portayed Socrates as a cheerful, down-to-earth character, who, like Aesop, solves moral problems with pragmatic attitude. When his friend Aristarchus complains that his house is full of deserted, bad-tempered female relatives, and he cannot feed so many mouths, Socrates advises him to give them productive work: "And so do you tell your flock yonder that like the dog in the fable you are their guardian and overseer, and it is thanks to you that they are protected from evil and evildoers, so that they work their work and live their lives in blissful security."

Cassandra makes an appearance in many plays and poems,  where often she is depicted in her most memorable role  - that of prophetess. So let us explore this compelling Greek heroine, and learn about Cassandra in myth and legend. [PAR] Cassandra is mentioned briefly in the Iliad of Homer (which, incidentally, is one of our oldest and most respected sources for information about the characters of Greek myth). Indeed, in the Iliad, we learn that Cassandra was the child of King Priam of Troy, and she was considered to be Priam's most beautiful daughter (Homer, Iliad, Book XIII, 365). However, no mention of Cassandra's notorious prophetic power is made in this Homeric epic. [PAR] We first find the tale of Cassandra and her legendary gifts in other works of ancient Greek literature. According to one version of the story, Cassandra received the power to foretell the future from the god Apollo . Apparently, Apollo instructed the mortal woman and taught her about the art of prophecy because he had an ulterior motive - the god wished to win her affections.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     [DOC] [TLE] LacrosseLacrosse is a contact team sport played between two teams using a small rubber ball (, 140 -) and a long-handled stick called a crosse or lacrosse stick. It is often considered as a rough sport,  with slashes and intense checks to the stick and body. The head of the lacrosse stick is strung with loose mesh designed to catch and hold the lacrosse ball. Offensively, the objective of the game is to score by shooting the ball into an opponent's goal past the goalie, using the lacrosse stick to catch, cradle, and pass the ball to do so. Defensively, the objective is to keep the other team from scoring and to gain the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact or positioning. The sport has four major types: men's field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The sport consists of four positions: midfield, attack, defense and goalie. In field lacrosse, attackmen are solely offensive players (except on the "ride", when the opposition tries to bring the ball upfield and attackmen must stop them), defensemen or defenders are solely defensive players (except when bringing up the ball, which is called a "clear"), the goalie is the last line of defense, directly defending the goal, and midfielders or "middies" can go anywhere on the field and play offense and defense, although in higher levels of lacrosse there are specialized offensive and defensive middies.

[PAR] Types of iron ore: Magnetite [PAR] As mentioned above, magnetite ore has a higher iron content than hematite ore, but often occurs in lower concentrations. That means it has to be concentrated before it can be used to produce steel. However, the ore’s magnetic properties help separate magnetite ore from rock during this process. [PAR] Magnetite ore is currently mined in Minnesota and Michigan in the US, as well as in taconite deposits in Eastern Canada. A major mining site in Michigan is the  Marquette Range . The deposit was discovered in 1844, and ore was first mined there in 1848, as per the Michigan government’s website.

For the first time in her life, she was popular. Her classmates liked her. She was invited to participate.  Her teachers admired her and encouraged her natural abilities. With no real home to return to, she occasionally stayed at the school during vacations, and accompanied her teachers on stimulating outings that exposed her to the treasures Europe had to offer.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     The Left Book Club was founded and directed by the publishe Victor Gollancz, who remained the most important influence on the club throughout its history. The Left Book Club was a highly successful publishing enterprise, and it developed into the  leading left-wing political movement of the 1930s in Britain. It attracted wide-ranging support, from Communists to left-wing Labourites and many Liberals.Its selections document the outlook of  most of the British Left of the 1930s and indicate the range of its interests. The author outlines the history of the club. The club is placed in the context of the political events of the 1930s and in the context of Gollancz's publishing career, his political beliefs, and his concern for  political education. Its organization as a book club is described and the range of its selection and activities is indicated. The last years of the Left Book Club, although of declining influence,  illustrate the course of the British Left from the disillusionment following the Nazi-Soviet Pact  and the split with the Communists to the concerns of the non-Communist Left during World War II and the election of the Labour government in 1945. Although it failed in its original goals, the Left Book Club helped shape the political thinking of a generation of British leftists.

Funny Folks began as a supplement to the Weekly Budget. Its popularity led to it being published as a separate weekly paper. The success of Funny Folks encouraged the publication of other weekly comics. One such comic was the famous Victorian comic, Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday (1884 - 1916). Ally Sloper’s Half Holiday was the inspiration of the engraver and publisher, Gilbert Dalziel. Ally Sloper had a characteristic red nose, battered top hat and he was usually drunk. Ally Sloper is notably the first ever comic strip hero and undoubtedly laid the foundations for the likes of Chubblock Homes -(Comic Cuts), Weary Willie and Tired Tim - (Illustrated Chips), Roy of the Rovers - (Tiger), Desperate Dan - (The Dandy), Dan Dare - (The Eagle) and more recently Judge Dredd - (2000AD).

It also marks the transformation of British writer W. Somerset Maugham from celebrated playwright to accomplished novelist. In The Moon and Sixpence, Charles Strickland is a respectable London stockbroker who decides in middle age to abandon his wife and children and devote himself to his true passion: art. Strickland's destructive desire for self-expression takes him first to Paris to learn the craft of painting, and finally to Tahiti in the South Pacific. The Moon and Sixpence remains a complex and engaging novel echoing Maugham's own struggles between artistic expression and public respectability, and between his public persona and private life. show more [PAR] Product details [PAR] 165.1                                     x 172.7

Although the latter pronunciation is closer to the Spanish pronunciation, it is not the pronunciation preferred by Nevadans. State Assemblyman Harry Mortenson proposed a bill to recognize the alternate (quasi-Spanish) pronunciation of Nevada,  though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote.  The native pronunciation is the de facto official one, since it is the one used by the state legislature.

[PAR] Updated March 05, 2016. [PAR] Did Davy Crockett Die in Battle at the Alamo?: [PAR] On March 6, 1836, Mexican forces stormed the Alamo, a fortress-like old mission in San Antonio where some 200 rebellious Texans had been holed up for weeks. The battle was over in less than two hours, leaving great Texas heroes like Jim Bowie, James Butler Bonham and William Travis dead. Among the defenders that day was Davy Crockett, former Congressman and legendary hunter, scout and teller of tall-tales. According to some accounts, Crockett died in battle and according to others, he was one of a handful of men captured and later executed. What really happened? [PAR] Davy Crockett: [PAR] Davy Crockett (1786-1836) was born in Tennessee, then a frontier territory. He was a hard working young man who distinguished himself as a scout in the Creek War and provided food for his whole regiment by hunting. Initially a supporter of Andrew Jackson , he was elected to Congress in 1827. He fell out with Jackson, however, and in 1835 lost his seat in Congress.

These types of animals have little to no other development within the mother. Mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth are known as monotremes. [PAR] Oviparous animals develop inside the egg while inside the mother's body. The birth is known as ovoviviparity. These animals mostly get their nourishment from the egg yolk instead of the mother's body.  Monotremes, mammals that lay eggs, are limited to the platypus and several species of spiny anteaters. These animals form an umbilical cord to the egg which feeds the baby inside the egg until hatched. These mammals are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     ” [PAR] While the etymology of Mjöllnir is uncertain, most scholars trace the name back to an Indo-European root that is attested in the Old Slavic word mlunuji, Russian molnija, and Welsh mellt, all of which mean “lightning.” It may also be related to the Icelandic words mjöll, “new snow,” and mjalli, “white,” the color of lightning and a potential symbol of purity.[2][3] The significance of that symbolism will become clear shortly. [PAR] Thor’s Hammer as an Instrument of Blessing, Consecration, and Protection [PAR] Thor’s hammer was certainly a weapon – the best weapon the Aesir had, in fact – but it was more than just a weapon. It also occupied a central role in rituals of consecration and hallowing. [PAR] The hammer was used in formal ceremonies to bless marriages, births, and probably funerals as well.[4] In one episode from medieval Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson’s Prose Edda , Thor once killed and ate his goats, then brought them back to life by hallowing their bones with his hammer[5] (talk about having your cake and eating it, too). The medieval Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus records that huge hammers were kept in one of Thor’s temples in Sweden, and that periodically the people would hold a ritual there that involved beating the hammers against some kind of drum that would resound like thunder.[6] This could have been a ceremony to bless and protect the community and ward off hostile spirits.

[PAR] Tigons however can reproduce with a male lion or male tiger, see also the table below: [PAR] Father [PAR] Tigon [PAR] Ti-tigon [PAR] Tigons can show traits of both parents, like producing lion and tiger sounds, having spots (lion) and stripes (tiger), enjoy water (tiger), males can have manes (lion). Tigons do not reach the gigantic sizes as the liger does, and usually do not reach the size of their parents. There are a lot less tigons than ligers, because it is much harder to get a male tiger to breed with a female lion than it is to breed a male lion with a female tiger.

[PAR] Hyposmia often affects the sense of taste, since taste and smell are so closely interlinked. If your hyposmia has damaged your sense of taste, you can make your food more appealing by using flavorful herbs and spices to season it, and by eating food in a variety of textures and colors. Butter, cheese, olive oil, toasted nuts, and bacon bits can be used if your diet permits it.

[PAR] Linda Thorson as Tara King and Patrick MacNee as John Steed in the final season of "The Avengers" [PAR] Although the rotation of Steed’s partners had been nearly a biannual occurrence while the series aired in England (a total of five men and women had paired up with Steed since 1961, including the incredibly popular Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg, and the less memorable Ian Hendry, Julie Stevens and Jon Rollason), American audiences had only ever known Steed and Peel.  Thus, the selection of the new Avengers girl would be an important task.  What was needed was not only an actress who could hold her own in the overbearing shadow of Diana Rigg, but one who could bring the same elegance, grace and sexual excitement to what was quickly becoming a painfully outdated franchise.  Twenty year old Canadian actress Linda Thorson proved to be the one who would give The Avengers that last push, creating an exciting final era for the beloved action series.

The star of the books Angels and Demons (2000), The Da Vinci Code (2004) and The Lost Symbol (2009), Langdon is a dashing scholar and professor of religious symbology at Harvard University, whose love of antiquities draws him into myterious and deadly adventures. In Angels and Demons he tangles with a secret society known as the Illuminati, and in The Da Vinci Code he investigates a murder in the Louvre and discovers mysterious clues leading to the Catholic Church, Jesus and Mary Magdalene , and Leonardo Da Vinci .  Langdon was played by actor Tom Hanks in the 2006 film of The Da Vinci Code; his colleague, the French cryptologist Sophie Neveu, was played by Audrey Tautou . Hanks reprised the role in the 2009 film of Angels and Demons, this time with actress Ayelet Zurer as his brainy female sidekick. [PAR] Extra credit: [PAR] In The DaVinci Code, Robert Langdon is described as looking like “ Harrison Ford in Harris tweed”… According to Angels and Demons, Langdon was “a varsity diver in prep school and in college”… In real life there is no professorship of religious symbology at Harvard; Brown invented the position for his tales.

This, however, does not mean that it is the National Language of India. [PAR] English is the subsidiary working language of the Indian Union. This shall continue indefinitely. The original plan was to completely replace English with Hindi over a span of fifteen year, but that got nixed in the aftermath of the anti-Hindi protests in South India.

Similar to Sir Christopher Wren, Sullivan benefited from a great fire. The Great Fire of 1871 in Chicago resulted in a construction boom and afforded architects like Sullivan with work for the decades to come. As a young man, he worked briefly in the offices of famed architects Frank Furness and then William Le Baron Jenney. He was only 24 years old when he became a partner in Dankmar Adler's firm in 1881. [PAR] As other architects like Jenney started implementing steel to allow for taller structures, the skyscraper was born. Sullivan was instrumental in creating a new functional design for these new tall buildings rather than sticking with outmoded traditions. Because of this, some refer to Sullivan as the "Father of the Skyscraper" (though others ascribe this title to Jenney). His designs also incorporated both geometric shapes and organic elements. Although most of his work was done in Chicago, his most famous work is the 10-story Wainwright building in St.

Vostok 1 orbited Earth at a maximum altitude of 187 miles and was guided entirely by an automatic control system. The only statement attributed to Gagarin during his one hour and 48 minutes in space was, “Flight is proceeding normally; I am well.” [PAR] After his historic feat was announced, the attractive and unassuming Gagarin became an instant worldwide celebrity.

Moreover, Gagarin had orbited Earth, a feat that eluded the U.S. space program until February 1962, when astronaut John Glenn made three orbits in Friendship 7.

This is despite the fact that it also contributes a major amount of revenue to government coffers. In China, the industry accounts for seven percent of the total revenue of the government.

Stakes are high and pressure is constant in the world of air traffic control, making the line between excellence and failure dangerously thin. While jokes provide the team of controllers with an important release from their stressful occupation, a narrow division exists between teasing and animosity. Mike Newell's careful research of the air traffic control profession, including its frequent emotional toll, lends a high level of realism to PUSHING TIN. Newell combines a depiction of the demandingly precise work done in air traffic control towers with an emotional portrait of the people charged with the safety of thousands of airline passengers and crew every day. The film also features the charming talents of Cate Blanchett and Angelina Jolie.

While its exact origins are not known, it is believed that the first version of the game was played by British soldiers who were stationed in India and South Africa . [PAR] Using cigar box lids as bats and corks from vine bottles as the ball, the soldiers tried to mimic outdoor tennis, using stacks of books as nets. When they returned to England, they improvised a little by creating rackets made from parchment stretched over a frame. [PAR] The game soon became a big hit, especially as an after-dinner entertainment for guests. The game was named Whiff-Whaff or Ping Pong because of the sound made by the cork ball, when hit by the parchment racket. [PAR] John Jacques, a maker of sports equipment, watched the growing popularity of the sport and decided to manufacture his own version of it. Introduced in 1891, it was called 'Gossima' and included a kit with two drum-type paddles, a wrapped cork ball and a net.

His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on the Baroque school of painting. [PAR] Caravaggio trained as a painter in Milan under a master who had himself trained under Titian. In his early twenties Caravaggio moved to Rome where, during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, many huge new churches and palazzi were being built and paintings were needed to fill them. During the Counter-Reformation the Roman Catholic Church searched for religious art with which to counter the threat of Protestantism, and for this task the artificial conventions of Mannerism, which had ruled art for almost a century, no longer seemed adequate. Caravaggio's novelty was a radical naturalism which combined close physical observation with a dramatic, even theatrical, use of chiaroscuro that came to be known as Tenebrism, the shift from light

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     The high temperatures required are generally found only deep within the earth. The rock is pulled down by movements in the earth's crust and gets hotter and hotter as it goes deeper. It takes temperatures between 600 and 1,300 degrees Celsius (1,100 and 2,400 degrees Fahrenheit) to melt a rock, turning it into a substance called magma (molten rock). [PAR] Cooling [PAR] What would you do to turn a melted chocolate bar back into a solid? You'd cool it by putting it into the refrigerator until it hardens. [PAR] Similarly, liquid magma also turns into a solid — a rock — when it is cooled. Any rock that forms from the cooling of magma is an igneous rock. Magma that cools quickly forms one kind of igneous rock, and magma that cools slowly forms another kind. [PAR] When magma rises from deep within the earth and explodes out of a volcano, it is called lava, and it cools quickly on the surface. Rock formed in this way is called extrusive igneous rock. It is extruded, or pushed, out of the earth's interior and cools outside of or very near the earth's surface. [PAR] What if the magma doesn't erupt out of a volcano, but instead gets pushed slowly upward toward the earth's surface over hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years? This magma will also cool, but at a much slower rate than lava erupting from a volcano. The kind of rock formed in this way is called intrusive igneous rock

It is sung in two places in the second act. After the death of the main male character, Billy Bigelow, his wife, Julie Jordan, recalls a song she learned in school about persevering in the face of life's difficulties. She begins to sing it, but can't continue, and it is taken up by her cousin Nettie Fowler. In the musical's final scene, it is sung by a chorus of students at a graduation ceremony. It is a simple, anthemic song written for a big soprano voice. Hammerstein's lyric is reassuring and uplifting, inspirational without being specifically religious, and Rodgers' music builds to a powerful climax. Carousel opened on Broadway on April 19, 1945, and, shortly after, Decca Records recorded an original Broadway cast album that concluded with a performance of "You'll Never Walk Alone" by John Raitt (who played Billy Bigelow), Christine Johnson (who played Nettie Fowler), Jan Clayton (who played Julie Jordan), and the chorus.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     The symbol is found on the Isle of Man, and earlier on Sicily . [4] The Manx triskelion is known in the Manx language as tre cassyn "the three legs". The symbol has been associated with the island since at least the 13th century. [1] [PAR] It is unknown how the tre cassyn were originally adopted, [1] and several theories have been put forward their origin. In 1607, English historian William Camden stated that the tre cassyn were derived from the Sicilian triskelion. In 1885 John Newton considered the tre cassyn to have originated in the mid 13th century, when the Pope offered the throne of Sicily to Edmund , son of King Henry III of England . Newton noted that the wife of King Alexander III of Scotland was Henry's daughter, and that Alexander visited the English court in 1255. Later in 1266, Norway ceded the Isle of Man to the Kingdom of Scotland , and Newton considered it likely that Alexander utilised the triskelion for the arms of his new possession. [5] [6] It has also been suggested that the ancestry of the tre cassyn can be traced to the triquetra in a coin of Amlaíb Cuarán , a 10th century Norse-Gael warlord who was king of Northumbria and king of Dublin . Lending credibility to this theory is the current belief that the mediaeval Manx dynasty was related to that of Amlaíb Cuarán.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     The development of spectroscopy around 1850 led to the discovery of such elements as caesium from the light that they emit or absorb. [PAR] In 1868, the French astronomer Pierre-Jules-César Janssen observed a total solar eclipse in India. His spectroscope showed an unfamiliar line in the light spectrum. English astronomer Norman Lockyer identified it as a new element, which he named helium after the greek god Helios. This discovery was controversial until helium was detected in various minerals on earth around 1890. [PAR] Helium is a major component of stars. On earth, it occurs in minerals not because it is bound chemically but because the helium nucleus is a product of radioactive decay of much larger atoms. This helium collects underground in pockets of natural gas and it is vented into the atmosphere. [PAR] Helium is used to fill balloons and blimps. It has unique properties at temperatures approaching absolute zero. Helium tanks are used to cool anything else to near that temperature, and helium is the subject of many cryogenic experiments. [PAR] Neon [PAR] Neon was discovered after krypton (see below) by Ramsay and Travers. They separated trace components from atmospheric argon, one of which produced a crimson spectrum. Neon means "new". [PAR] Neon was the first gas used in so-called neon signs. It is relatively expensive because of its rarity.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     Spanish occupation lasted over 3 centuries until 1898, when Spain signed a treaty passing control of the Philippines to the United States. Two years after Japanese occupation (1942–44), the Philippines gained independence but inherited 2 major security threats from the communist-led Huk rebels in the north of Luzon and the Moro secessionist rebels in southern Mindanao. The Philippine army finally defeated the Huk rebels in 1954, but the Moro insurgency continued into the 1970s when President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, lasting until 1981, in an attempt to destroy the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari. With material support from Libya the MNLF was able to sustain military campaigns against government troops demanding independence for areas under predominantly Muslim population. In 1996, the government under President Fidel Ramos initiated a dialogue that led to the signing of a peace agreement providing for self-rule for Muslims in the southern Philippines. While the agreement ended 3 decades of rebellion that claimed over 120,000 lives, minor skirmishes are still faced by government security forces from 2 other groups outside the MNLF: the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the Abu Sayyaf. The latter group became notorious after a number of kidnapping incidents involving both local and foreign victims, including the well-publicized kidnapping of 21 foreign tourists on the island of Sipadan on April 23, 2000

For example, in Japanese Zen temples, the Roshi , or spiritual head, is in charge of teaching novices, but there is also a head monk who is in charge of the practical business of running the institution. In the large monasteries, there are many officials in charge of different aspects of a multi-faceted and complex organization. [PAR] The duties of clergy toward laypersons are varied. Monks will perform rituals on request, such as funerals, and they also conduct the ceremonies on the yearly ritual calendar. In a popular temple, monks might also tell fortunes, sell talismans, or create calligraphic seals for tourists. All the monks work together to prepare for holiday and festival celebrations. If the monastery has a school for children or a university, some of the monks serve as teachers. If it is a monastery that trains monks, senior monks will serve as meditation teachers, scripture teachers, and so forth. Some monasteries offer vocational training for the laity; others operate medical clinics. In some monasteries, the day to day labor-cooking, cleaning, and so forth is done by lay volunteers; in others, particularly in Japanese Zen monasteries, all the work is done by the monks. [PAR]

[1] [PAR] Contents [PAR]   Etymology [PAR]   "The third gift—an enormous hammer" (1902) by Elmer Boyd Smith. [PAR] Mjölnir simply means "crusher", referring to its pulverizing effect. Mjölnir might be related to the Russian word молния (molniya) and the Welsh word mellt (both words being translated as "lightning"). This second theory parallels with the idea that Thor , being a god of thunder, therefore might have used lightning as his weapon. [2] It is related to words such as the Icelandic verbs mölva ("to crush") and mala ("to grind"), and Swedish noun mjöl ("flour"), all related to English meal, mill, and miller. Similar words, all stemming from the Proto-Indo-European root *melə, can be found in almost all European languages, e.g. the Slavic melevo ("grain to be ground") and molot ("hammer"), the Greek μύλος (mylos—"mill"), and the Latin malleus "hammer", from which English mallet derives.

You wanted an example of a mammal that does not have 'fur'? Humans. Our follicles produce a single hair each. [PAR] Like Glen pointed out - Birds are warm blooded. So while Mammals have warm blood - it is not an exclusive characteristic to them alone. [PAR] Also non exclusive is the live birth thing which many associate with being mammalian, as some mammals (monotremes) do not give birth to live young.

Numerous cuneiform tablets and ancient texts speak of his wondrous achievements and prideful character. "Look at this, Babylon the great! And I built it all by myself, a royal palace adequate to display my honor and glory." Nebuchadnezzar trusted in his immense wealth and powerful warriors -- He had no room for God in his kingdom. [PAR] However, late in his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a philosophical wake-up call. Overnight, he went from mighty king to wandering madman, as he was stricken with a psycho-mania, which caused him to act like an animal. He grew long hair and nails, roaming about the countryside grazing on grass. [PAR] Seven years into his malady, Nebuchadnezzar returned to his senses; immediately, he knew his lifelong mistake.

The C. chinense varieties Habanero and Scotch Bonnet are considered the hottest. [PAR] The interest in peppers extends to their nutritive and medicinal value in that peppers are a recognized source of Vitamins C and E and are high in antioxidants. These compounds are associated with prevention of cardiovascular disorders, cancers, and cataracts. [PAR] Peppers are a warm-season crop and need a long season for maximum production. Temperature has a large effect on the rate of plant and fruit growth and the development and quality of the red or yellow pigments. Ideal temperature for red pigment development is between 65 and 75 F. Above this range the red color becomes yellowish, and below it color development slows dramatically and stops completely below 55 F. [PAR] Many excellent pepper varieties are available. Test several and select the ones that do well under your production system, and meets your market needs. [PAR] Pacific Northwest pepper growers may improve their chances for successful pepper production by using raised beds ( to improve drainage), by using plastic mulches (to warm the soil and control weeds), and drip irrigation (to promote uniform moisture and fertilizer delivery), and by staking plants (to reduce plant breakage and disease -- improves air movement).

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     With the exception of the repeated use of one mild obscenity, MY FAIR LADY is an excellent, enjoyable, entertaining, musical comedy well worth revisiting. [PAR] Review: [PAR] The multiple Oscar-winning MY FAIR LADY is a musical comedy that brings George Bernard Shaw's famous play PYGMALION to the big screen with some wonderful twists and great music. Professor Henry Higgins, a dialect specialist in turn-of-the-century London, claims to a friend that he could raise the social level of anyone simply by altering the manner in which they speak. To test this theory, he selects Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, and begins to give her elocution lessons. Eliza's transformation into a high society lady is not an easy transition and the experiment produces some unexpected and humorous results. [PAR] This is a charming and delightful musical with a superb range of engaging, character-driven tunes. As should be expected with a musical based on a work by Shaw, Fabian Socialist morality is presented and debated within the movie. However, the storyline of the musical subtly refutes the play's anti-morality arguments and comes down on the side of morality in the end. Moreover, with the exception of the repeated use of one minor obscenity and one minor vulgarity, any other offensive elements are only implied, often refuted and never explicitly shown. With its memorable music and wonderful performances, MY FAIR LADY is an enjoyable musical comedy worth revisiting. [PAR] In Brief:[DOC] [TLE] My Fair Lady: Musical Play in Two Acts Based

It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy, and high ratings. By its 40th anniversary in 2009, Sesame Street was broadcast in over 120 countries, and 20 international versions had been produced. [PAR] Sesame Street has evolved from its initial inception. According to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s the show had become "an American institution". The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to, and expanded, other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign broadcast income.  Sesame Streets curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships, ethics, and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew, most notably, the 1982 death of Will Lee—who played Mr. Hooper—and the marriage

This new stage version of the novel is a completely fresh adaptation by Julian Fellowes, Oscar-winning screenwriter and creator of Downton Abbey. [PAR] Arthur Kipps, an orphan, is an over-worked draper’s assistant at Shalford’s Bazaar, Folkestone, at the turn of the last century. He is a charming but ordinary young man who, along with his fellow apprentices, dreams of a better and more fulfilling world, but he likes his fun just like any other, except not quite. [PAR] When Kipps unexpectedly inherits a fortune that propels him into high society, it confuses everything he thought he knew about life. Watching him wrestle with his new identity is his childhood companion and not-quite girlfriend, Ann Pornick, who sees with dismay how Arthur is being made over in a new image by the beautiful and classy Helen Walsingham. She is always there with helpful hints on how Arthur could improve himself and make his life richer and more meaningful, if only he would believe in himself, and listen to her. Both of these young women love Arthur – there is no doubt about that – but which should he listen to? With the help of his friends, Arthur learns that if you want to have the chance of living the right life, you need to make the right choices.

[PAR] It is a common misconception that Anne Boleyn, upon her arrest and arrival at the Tower of London, entered through Traitor’s Gate. On the late afternoon of May 2nd 1536 the barge conducting Anne to the Tower landed at The Tower Gate, now days known as Byward Tower. It was here through the Court Cate in the Byward Tower, and not at Traitor’s Gate, that Anne was conducted within the walls of the great Tower of London. [PAR] According to Historic Royal palaces ‘Experience the Tower of London Guide’ Traitors’ Gate was “originally built for Edward I between 1275 and 1279, this new watergate called St Thomas’s Tower was a daring variation on the traditional defensive gate tower. Discreetly defended by arrowloops, the building had gilded window bars and painted sculpture on its exterior. Edward’s royal barge could be moored beneath the great archway, built using cutting edge Crusader castle-construction technology gleaned from the King’s time fighting in the Holy Land.” (p. 21) [PAR] In addition the guide states that “the timber framing above the archway is a memento of happy times for Anne Boleyn. It was constructed in 1532 by Henry VIII’s Master Carpenter, James Nedeham, as part of the excited rush to renovate the Tower ready for Anne’s coronation in June 1533” (p.

The bride’s father, Sigmund Haffner, had been a wealthy businessman and the town’s mayor; after his death in 1772, his son (also Sigmund) took charge of the family’s affairs, including his sister’s wedding. [PAR] The younger Sigmund Haffner asked his friend since childhood, Mozart, to contribute party music for the opulent festivities. Mozart responded with an eight-movement Serenade in D major, a work of unprecedented scope and sophistication in a genre that most composers of the day treated as disposable background music. The Haffner Serenade debuted the night before the wedding, with Mozart likely conducting and playing the solo violin part himself. Recognizing that this serenade warranted more than a single use, Mozart and his father, Leopold, bundled the five movements without solo violin into a symphony, adding only a part for timpani (written in Leopold’s hand).

A pop and R&B ballad, "Grenade" was written and produced by The Smeezingtons (Mars, Phillip Lawrence, Ari Levine) with additional songwriting by Brody Brown, Claude Kelly, and Andrew Wyatt. The song was developed from an unreleased track with similar lyrical themes played by record producer Benny Blanco to Mars. "Grenade" was completely rearranged and re‑recorded two days before the album's release. The song's lyrics carry a message of unrequited love and how Mars' heart was broken, despite his best efforts to show her his love. Initially released as a promotional single on September 28, 2010, it was later announced as the album's second single, released by Atlantic and Elektra Records. [PAR] "Grenade" was well received by critics, praising the vocals and emotional lyrics of the song and also considered it as one of the stand-out tracks on Doo-Wops & Hooligans. The single reached number one in fifteen different countries, giving Mars his third number one single on the Billboard Hot 100, and topping the Canadian Hot 100 for three non-consecutive weeks.

[PAR] The vast majority of Surrey home matches are played at the historic Kia Oval cricket ground in Kennington, south London but the club also has two ‘out grounds’ where some home games each season are also played. These are Whitgift School in Croydon and Guildford Cricket Club on the Woodbridge Road, Guildford. This year the Guildford Cricket Club hosted Surrey’s LV County Championship game against Warwickshire and Yorkshire Bank 40 game against Lancashire in June as part of the Guildford Cricket Festival. [PAR] Surrey County Cricket Club has had three notable periods of success in its history starting when the club was unofficially proclaimed as ‘Champion County’ seven times during the 1850s.

[PAR] Legal Mimimum Marriage Age; Past and Present [PAR] Custom Search [PAR] There is a lot of criticism on marriage age in Islam. Some allege that Muslim marriage law allows marriage of minors. However, Quran indicates at least on one place that there is definite age which can be termed as age of marriage: [PAR] “Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up.” [PAR] (Quran 4: 6 Abdullah Yusufali) [PAR] The Muslim jurists agree that the ‘age of marriage’ mentioned here is age of puberty. Shafis alone declare that age of 15 years should be taken as age of marriage. Other branches of Islam don’t give any specific age but agree that age of marriage can be different in different regions depending upon the age of puberty. Furthermore, consent of a Muslim marriage partner is not recognized unless she reaches to the age of puberty. [PAR] Recent History [PAR] Different societies have been accepting different levels of age as marriage age in different times.

But due to a conflict with the theater, Beethoven withdrew the score after just two performances. It did not resurface again until 1814, by which time the composer had reworked the entire score and written yet another overture (now known as the “Fidelio” overture and played today after the opera.) That is the version performed today. [PAR] Over the decade of his work on “Fidelio,” Beethoven’s hearing continued to deteriorate, and with it his emotional composure.

When Seilenos (Silenus) --an elderly companion of the god Dionysos --was separated from his master's company, Midas captured him with the lure of wine. He treated the old satyr hospitably and after returning him to the god was rewarded with a wish. He prayed for a golden touch--a boon which quickly proved  a curse when the king discovered his food also transformed. Petitioning the god again, he was instructed to bathe in the river Paktolos (Pactolus) which not only rid him of the power but also imbued the river's sands with gold. [PAR] The king was later called upon to judge a musical contest between the gods Apollon and Pan (or   the satyr Marsyas ). The foolish man declared his preference for the music of the pipe and was afflicted with a pair of asses' ears by the angry god. Ashamed of this deformity,  Midas hid the ears beneath the flaps of a Phrygian cap--the traditional head-gear of the local nobility--but a maid whispered his secret into a patch of reeds and the truth was outed. [PAR] Midas was also the legendary founder of the city of Ankyra (Ankara)--which today is the capital of Turkey.

It made one of its first trips on the new route on a Friday morning with 543 people, 84 cars and 36 trucks on board as it headed across the English Channel to Dover. [PAR] The Herald was designed to allow vehicles to drive on and off the ship quickly and easily.  Still, in order to save even more time, it was the unofficial policy of the ship’s crew to leave port with the bow doors open and to close them as the ship was already moving, a practice that allowed a small, but normally inconsequential, amount of water into the ferry. The March 6 trip left port with the doors open and the person assigned to close them asleep in a bunk.  (It was later revealed that this, too, was not unusual.)  The crew members who were supposed to take over this assignment were unable to close the doors as the Herald pushed out to sea. [PAR] As crew members frantically pounded the doors with hammers, water flooded into the cargo hold. The vehicles in the hold were tossed back and forth in the water, and a sudden shift in weight caused the ship to tip to the port side.  Within minutes, the Herald capsized.

The movie is played so incredibly loud my wife fishes earplugs out of her purse. It begins as a rock’n’roll assault of sound and image as a gonzo climber races into the desert, biking and hiking, headphones cranked. But as he rushes to hit road,  a shelf cam dwells on the Swiss Army knife he forgets to pack. A telling moment. The dinky little instrument he will eventually use to  perform surgery on himself is a cheap, blunt cutting tool that came with a stocking-stuffer flashlight.

Alice Kipling (one of four remarkable Victorian sisters)[13] was a vivacious woman[14] about whom a future Viceroy of India would say, "Dullness and Mrs. Kipling cannot exist in the same room."[2] Lockwood Kipling, a sculptor and pottery designer, was the principal and professor of architectural sculpture at the newly founded Sir Jamsetji Jejeebhoy School of Art and Industry in Bombay.[14] The couple, who had moved to India earlier that year, had met in courtship two years before at Rudyard Lake in rural Staffordshire, England, and had been so taken by its beauty that they now named their firstborn after it.[15] Kipling's birthplace home still stands on the campus of the Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art in Mumbai and for many years was used as the Dean's residence. Mumbai historian Foy Nissen points out however that although the cottage bears a plaque stating that this is the site where Kipling was born the fact of the matter is that the original cottage was pulled down decades ago and a new one built in its place.

This would give the UK two land borders. Denmark has a similar situation with Sweden (which would give it two borders, or possibly three depending on the ultimate disposition of Hans Island). Bahrain has a similar situation with Saudi Arabia, which would give it one land border.

[PAR] Von Lamont (1805-1879), a Scottish born astronomer who lived most of his life in Munich, is famed for his determination of the orbits of moons of Saturn and Uranus, and also for discovering the periodic fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field. He recorded Neptune on at least three occasions, namely on 25 October 1845, 7 September 1846 and 11 September 1846. As a highly skilled observer, one might have expected that von Lamont would have recognised the motion of Neptune over the four day period. However he failed to do so, only days before Neptune was discovered. [PAR] The discovery of Neptune however did not come from any of these chance observations. Rather it came from a mathematical analysis of the deviation of Uranus from its predicted orbit.

Historians are fairly certain that the origins of these pastries can be traced to the town of Eccles, formerly within the Lancashire boundary, but now a suburb of Manchester. [PAR] Samuel Edmonds, Grandfather of Ian, [PAR] pictured in 1929 with his [PAR] Model T Ford delivery van. [PAR] The word “Eccles” means ‘church’ and is a derivative of the Greek ‘Ecclesia’, which means an assembly.  Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the town takes its name from the old church, constructed in 1111 A.D., around which it grew. [PAR] Each year during the passing centuries a Service was held at the church to celebrate its construction.  This became known as the “Eccles Wakes” and was followed by a fair where food and drink could be purchased in abundance, including the ever popular Eccles Cake. [PAR] When Oliver Cromwell gained power in 1650 A.D., both the wakes and the eating of Eccles Cakes were banned due to the Puritan belief that they both had pagan connections.

It lived and nested on the ground and ate fruits that had fallen from trees. There were no mammals on the island and a high diversity of bird species lived in the dense forests.

The head is pointed and the mouth is large. The head is dark blue, the back is dark blue with about 30 dark wavy lines, and the undersides are silver green. The widely separated first and second dorsal fins serve to distinguish Pacific mackerel from all of the other tuna-like fishes that inhabit our waters, except for the frigate and bullet mackerel. Pacific mackerel and bullet mackerel can be differentiated by counting the dorsal finlets. Pacific mackerel typically have four to six, while bullet and frigate mackerel have seven to eight finlets. [PAR] Range: Worldwide in temperate seas; in the eastern Pacific from Chile to the Gulf of Alaska.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     “It’s unfortunate we don’t have more operas from him.” [PAR] In fact, the choice to include “Fidelio” in this final year of the cycle, was made intentionally to acknowledge Beethoven’s  influence on the work of Verdi, says DeRenzi, who conducted “Fidelio” both times the company previously performed it,  in 1985 and 1995.  The production opening this weekend has new sets and will be conducted by Eckhart Wycik, like Beethoven, a German. [PAR] While Beethoven was already well established as a symphonic composer by the time he entered his early thirties at the turn of the century, opera was a road to greater prominence. When he was invited to write one for a theater in Vienna, he agreed, settling for a source on a work by French playwright J.N. Bouilly, “Leonore, ou L’amour conjugal.” [PAR] Beethoven began “Leonore” – the name was later changed to differentiate it from two previously written operas of that name -- in 1804, at a dark time in his life, when he had begun to lose his hearing and was deeply depressed by the prospects for both his professional and personal life. It premiered  as a three-act libretto the following year in Vienna. But it was not well received, primarily because the city was under French military occupation, and most of the audience members were French military officers, more accustomed to Italian opera.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     [DOC] [TLE] MordantA mordant is a substance used to set dyes on fabrics or tissue sections by forming a coordination complex with the dye which then  attaches to the fabric or tissue.  It may be used for dyeing fabrics, or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. The term mordant comes from the present participle of French mordre, "to bite". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing.  A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion.  The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. [PAR] Common dye mordants [PAR] Mordants include tannic acid, alum, urine, chrome alum, sodium chloride, and certain salts of aluminium, chromium, copper, iron, iodine, potassium, sodium, and tin. [PAR] Iodine is often referred to as a mordant in Gram stains, but is in fact a trapping agent.  [PAR] Dyeing methods [PAR] The three methods used for mordanting are: [PAR] * Pre-mordanting (onchrome): The substrate is treated with the mordant and then dyed. [PAR] * Meta-mordanting (metachrome): The mordant is added in the dye bath itself. [PAR] * Post-mordanting (afterchrome): The dyed material is treated with a mordant.

[PAR] The name of the stadium was announced as the 'New York Stadium' on 19 December 2011, chosen ahead of 'The Foundry' and 'The Waterfront Stadium'. The reason for the name is that the area of land that the stadium lies upon is called New York, and it was thought that it would be better to name the stadium after history and/or where the stadium is situated, like nearby stadiums Bramall Lane and Hillsborough. Chairman Tony Stewart also hopes that the name could bring investment from New York City or further afield, as the New York Yankees chairman had recently said that he wanted to invest in an English football team.

Within this biofilm are bacteria that feed on food particles and sugars in the mouth. The byproduct of this bacterial feeding frenzy are acids that erode tooth enamel and cause cavities. By removing plaque through brushing and flossing, you prevent these acids from eating enamel and help protect the teeth against decay and infection. [PAR] Tartar is the name given to plaque that has hardened. This process begins within hours of plaque forming, but may take up to 48 hours to complete. Once formed, tartar will continue to harden – holding and protecting all acids and bacteria fast to the teeth – until it is removed. [PAR] Plaque is easy to remove with brushing and flossing. Tartar, on the other hand, may be impossible to remove at home. This is but one of many reasons you should visit our Austin office every six months for professional cleanings . During these cleanings, tartar can be removed from all surfaces of the teeth, providing you with a fresh foundation for your daily routine. What’s more, the examinations performed immediately after your cleanings can be used to detect damage done in between visits and to create a treatment plan that protects the long-term health of your smile.

It is distinguished from both peacebuilding, peacemaking, and peace enforcement. [PAR] Peacekeepers monitor and observe peace processes in post-conflict areas and assist ex-combatants in implementing the peace agreements they may have signed. Such assistance comes in many forms, including confidence-building measures, power-sharing arrangements, electoral support, strengthening the rule of law, and economic and social development. Accordingly, UN peacekeepers (often referred to as Blue Berets or Blue Helmets because of their light blue berets or helmets) can include soldiers, police officers, and civilian personnel. [PAR] The United Nations Charter gives the United Nations Security Council the power and responsibility to take collective action to maintain international peace and security. For this reason, the international community usually looks to the Security Council to authorize peacekeeping operations through Chapter VI authorizations.  [PAR] Most of these operations are established and implemented by the United Nations itself, with troops serving under UN operational control. In these cases, peacekeepers remain members of their respective armed forces, and do not constitute an independent "UN army," as the UN does not have such a force.

Peripheral nerves connect the brain and spinal cord to muscles and to sensory cells that detect sensations such as touch, pain, heat, and sound. Damage to the peripheral nerves can result in loss of sensation and wasting (atrophy) of muscles in the feet, legs, and hands. [PAR] Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease usually becomes apparent in adolescence or early adulthood, but onset may occur anytime from early childhood through late adulthood. Symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity, even among members of the same family.  Some people never realize they have the disorder, but most have a moderate amount of physical disability. A small percentage of people experience severe weakness or other problems which, in rare cases, can be life-threatening.  In most affected individuals, however, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease does not affect life expectancy.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     We can show you how the carbon cycle works, by means of an explanation and a schematic representation. --> Move to the Carbon Cycle . [PAR] Applications of carbon dioxide by humans [PAR] Humans use carbon dioxide in many different ways. The most familiar example is its use in soft drinks and beer, to make them fizzy. Carbon dioxide released by baking powder or yeast makes cake batter rise. [PAR] Some fire extinguishers use carbon dioxide because it is denser than air. Carbon dioxide can blanket a fire, because of its heaviness. It prevents oxygen from getting to the fire and as a result, the burning material is deprived of the oxygen it needs to continue burning. [PAR] Carbon dioxide is also used in a technology called supercritical fluid extraction that is used to decaffeinate coffee. The solid form of carbon dioxide, commonly known as Dry Ice, is used in theatres to create stage fogs and make things like "magic potions" bubble. [PAR] The part carbon dioxide plays in environmental processes [PAR] Carbon dioxide is one of the most abundant gasses in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide plays an important part in vital plant and animal process, such as photosynthesis and respiration. These processes will be briefly explained here. [PAR] Green plants convert carbon dioxide and water into food compounds, such as glucose, and oxygen. This process is called photosynthesis. [PAR] The reaction of photosynthesis is as follows: [PAR] 6 CO2 + 6 H2O --> C6H12O6 + 6 O2 [PAR] Plants and animals, in turn, convert the food compounds by combining it with oxygen to release energy for growth and other life activities.

During a trip abroad from 1872 to 1873, 26-year-old Colonel M. Lewis Clark devised a plan to create the Louisville Jockey Club for conducting race meets, after meeting with prominent racing leaders in France and England. Upon his return, Clark developed a racetrack, which would become known as Churchill Downs that would showcase Kentucky's breeding industry. To fund construction of the project, he sold 320 membership subscriptions to the track for $100 each. Clark then leased eighty acres of land, about three miles south of Louisville's downtown, from his uncles, John and Henry Churchill, for the track, a clubhouse, grandstand, and porter's lodge.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     S. It is the westernmost major tributary of the Yukon River . The Innoko rises in the Kuskokwim Mountains west of the town of McGrath and flows north and then southwest for about 500 miles (800 km) before joining the Yukon near Holy Cross. The river’s drainage area is about 2,500 square miles (6,500 square km). The name Innoko, first used by the Russian explorer Lavrenty Zagoskin during his 1842–44 expedition, is probably a Deg Xinag Indian word, but its meaning is unknown.

For a long time Esch was a small farming village in the valley of the Uelzecht river. This changed when important amounts of iron ore were found in the area in the 1850s. With the development of the mines and the steel industry the town's population multiplied tenfold in a couple of decades. In 1911 the steel and iron producing company ARBED was founded.[1] and the development of the steel industry, especially in the south of the country, provided Luxembourg with sustained economic growth during the second half of the 19th century.[2] In the 1970s as a result of the steel crisis the mines and many of the blast furnaces were shut down, the last one, in Esch-Belval, definitely halting its operations in 1997.[2] The blast furnaces were replaced by an electric furnace that is fed with scrap metal rather than iron ore.[3] Today the industrial wastelands on Belval left behind by the steel industry, are being redeveloped and converted into a new, modern city quarter. New cultural buildings such as the cinema Utopolis Belval[4] and the Rockhal, Luxemburg’s biggest concert hall,[5] schools, flats and Belval Plaza, a shopping centre, have been built in the last years. The area around the old blast furnaces will host different structures of the University of Luxembourg, many research centres and the national archives.[6] Two of the University's three faculties will relocate there: The Faculty of Arts, Humanities and Education Sciences will first do so

[PAR] Origin and secretarial uses [PAR] The word originated in ancient Rome, for a slave at his master's personal service "within hand reach", performing any command; later it was specifically applied to an intimately trusted servant (often a freedman) acting as a personal secretary (amanuensis is what he does, not what he is).  [PAR] A similar semantic evolution occurred at the French royal court, where the secrétaire de la main du roi, originally a lowly clerk specializing in producing, at royal command, the Sovereign's signature on more documents than he cared to put his pen to, developed into the secrétaires d'état, the first permanent portfolio ministers, to which the British Secretaries of State would be the counterpart. [PAR] The term is often used interchangeably with secretary or scribe. [PAR] Academic uses [PAR] It is also used in a specific sense in some academic contexts, for instance when an injured or disabled person is helped by an amanuensis at a written examination.   A notable case in classical music was that of Eric Fenby, who assisted the blind composer Frederick Delius in writing down the notes that Delius dictated.

I find them hilarious and yet sentimental in an inexplicable way that only the English could pull off. They have this dry, quiet, understated and sweet manner, and sing these sleepy, sleepy nostalgic songs like “Underneath the Arches”, “Run, Rabbit, Rabbit” and “The Umbrella Man”, a tune I loved so much I got David Gochfeld and Michael Townsend Wright to perform it in my vaudeville show a few years back.

After sporadic visits by fishermen from the north and by European explorers and merchants starting in the 17th century, the eastern half of the continent was claimed by the British in 1770 and officially settled as the penal colony of New South Wales on 26 January 1788. As the population grew and new areas were explored, another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies were successively established over the course of the 19th century.

A person with aphasia may have difficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing the names of objects, or understanding what other people have said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury, as may occur during a traumatic accident or when the brain is deprived of oxygen during a stroke . It may also be caused by a brain tumor , a disease such as Alzheimer's, or an infection, like encephalitis . Aphasia may be temporary or permanent. Aphasia does not include speech impediments caused by loss of muscle control. [PAR] Description [PAR] To understand and use language effectively, an individual draws upon word memory-stored information on what certain words mean, how to put them together, and how and when to use them properly.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     [DOC] [TLE] Time-window of occurrence and vegetation cover preferences ...24.6 · Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes [PAR] Abstract [PAR] Wildfires are the most extensive and severe disturbance affecting the shrublands where Sardinian and Dartford Warblers (Sylvia melanocephala and S. undata) abound. Estimating the long-term use of burned habitats by these species (i.e. their time-window of occurrence) is fundamental to understanding their regional distribution and to plan possible conservation measures for the near-threatened Dartford Warbler. In this study, we describe the post-fire time-window of occurrence and cover preferences of the two warblers using an abundance dataset, gathered by point counts over 22 consecutive years, and a density dataset, resulting from territory mapping of four different plots for up to 8 years. Both datasets span before and after fire. The two species colonized burned areas as soon as the second year after fire. The Dartford Warbler showed its highest abundance between 4 and 9 years after fire and disappeared after 16 years or more. The Sardinian Warbler had a peak of abundance at 9 years, but the study was not long enough to record its local extinction. Partial least squares regression showed that abundance at points and plot density of the Dartford Warbler were positively related to the plant cover between 0.25 and 1 m, whereas vegetation between 0.5 and 4 m was important for the Sardinian Warbler. The Dartford Warbler, therefore, depends on the existence of dense and low shrublands, that are often the result of past fires.

He also praised R C Sherriff’s script, a ‘masterpiece of understatement’, something that he was keen to preserve in his direction. And he confessed that he was still moved by the final scene, where Gibson tells Barnes Wallis, distraught at the loss of 56 men, that even if all the men had known that they wouldn’t be coming back, ‘they’d have gone for it just the same. I knew them all and I know that’s true.’ Wallis isn’t really consoled, but he accepts what Gibson says, and suggests that the CO should get some sleep. This Gibson cannot yet do, and he delivers the film’s final line of dialogue: ‘I have to write some letters first.’ Without another word, Wallis stumbles out of shot and Gibson marches towards his office, exchanging salutes with a passing sergeant. As John Ramsden remarks in his BFI monograph: ‘It is as fine a moment as actor, screenwriter or director ever managed in a film, and coming at the very end, its result is devastating.’ (John Ramsden, The Dam Busters, Tauris 2003, p.95.)

In mid-nineteenth-century England, a period marked by political upheaval, mass industrialization, and social ills, the Brotherhood at its inception strove to transmit a message of artistic renewal and moral reform by imbuing their art with seriousness, sincerity, and truth to nature. [PAR] At London’s Royal Academy and Free Exhibition shows of 1849, several paintings were exhibited with the cryptic initials “P.R.B.” along with the artists’ signatures; among these were Rienzi Vowing to Obtain Justice for the Death of His Young Brother, Slain in a Skirmish between the Colonna and Orsini Factions (private collection) by William Holman Hunt (1827–1910), Isabella (Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) by John Everett Millais (1829–1896), and the Girlhood of Mary Virgin (Tate, London) by Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828–1882). These canvases, though diverse in subject, embodied the Brotherhood’s initial aims in their keen observation of the natural world and depiction of subjects that lead the viewer to contemplate moral issues of justice, piety, familial relationships, and the struggle of purity against corruption.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     [PAR] Now zoologist Jeremy Austin of the Australian Center for Ancient DNA and his colleagues are examining DNA from animal droppings found in Tasmania in the late 1950s and 1960s, which have been preserved in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. [PAR] Eric Guiler, a thylacine expert who found the scats, said he thought the droppings probably came from the Tasmanian tiger rather than a dog, Tasmanian devil or a quoll, according to Austin. [PAR] “If we find thylacine DNA from the 1950s scats it will be significant,” Austin said. “This would prove that either the thylacine produced the scat or a [Tasmanian] devil ate a thylacine and dropped the scat. Either way that is proof that the thylacine was there at the time.” [PAR] If they were to find evidence the Tasmanian tiger  was alive between its last sightings in the wild (between 1910 and 1920), that would mean the beast was hidden from humans for 40 to 50 years. [PAR] “If they could survive this long with no real physical proof, then it does add a little more hope to the possibility that they could survive another 50 years without ever being caught, killed [or] hit by a car,” Austin told LiveScience. “This chance is of course not great, but the glimmer of hope is ever so slightly brighter.”[DOC] [TLE] EDGE :: Mammal Species Information - EDGE of ExistenceEDGE :: Mammal Species Information [PAR] Order: Dasyuromorphia [PAR]

[PAR] Bowie would have been a killer Captain Hook.Source:YouTube [PAR] Cast: Both Kevin Kline and Tom Hanks were considered for the role of Peter Pan, which of course eventually went to Robin Williams.

2025-04-08 23:14:56 INFO     Instead of catching up with our characters where we left them last time, we are instead placed back in the Mines of Moria with Gandalf facing off against the Balrog, an event that took place just over halfway through the first film. Whereas in Fellowship we saw him fall to his presumed death, this time we follow him down the vast chasm as he first retrieves his sword and then proceeds to engage in a vicious fight with the fiery demon in a jaw dropping display of CGI enhanced pyrotechnics. The long shot of the two shown as specks falling in the distance as the chasm expands into a vast underground cave at the foot of the mountain, the music swelling to a crescendo, is an awe inspiring image and comes to an abrupt end as they hit the lake at the bottom causing Frodo to wake from this nightmarish dream/vision. The scene works on a number of levels, firstly as a reintroduction to a key event from the first film, an insight into Frodo's grief and an illustration of Gandalf's true fate. It also puts the audience in no doubt as to the fact that this film will be at least the equal of its predecessor in terms of sheer spectacle. [PAR] Sam and Frodo are then accosted by the creature that has been hunting them since Moria, Gollum. One of the many feats that The Two Towers pulls off with aplomb is successfully creating the first truly convincing CGI character on screen.

The rough logging        camps were ideal learning environments as the range of possible activities        was limited to conversation and work. The apprentice mahout could absorb        the wealth of technical details which were necessary knowledge for handling        the elephant and working in the forest through conversations with the        senior mahouts and watching them in action during the three to five months        of uninterrupted work in the forest.

Nineteen panzer divisions, 3,000 tanks, 2,500 aircraft, and 7,000 artillery pieces pour across a thousand-mile front as Hitler goes to war on a second front. [PAR] Despite the fact that Germany and Russia had signed a “pact” in 1939, each guaranteeing the other a specific region of influence without interference from the other, suspicion remained high. When the Soviet Union invaded Rumania in 1940, Hitler saw a threat to his Balkan oil supply. He immediately responded by moving two armored and 10 infantry divisions into Poland, posing a counterthreat to Russia. But what began as a defensive move turned into a plan for a German first-strike. Despite warnings from his advisers that Germany could not fight the war on two fronts (as Germany’s experience in World War I proved), Hitler became convinced that England was holding out against German assaults, refusing to surrender, because it had struck a secret deal with Russia.

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO     [PAR] In 1948, South Africa’s white minority government institutionalized its policy of racial segregation and white supremacy known as apartheid–Afrikaans for “apartness.” Eighty percent of the country’s land was set aside for white use, and black Africans entering this territory required special passes. Blacks, who had no representation in the government, were subjected to different labor laws and educational standards than whites and lived in extreme poverty while white South Africans prospered. [PAR] Organized anti-apartheid protests began in the 1950s, and in the 1960s Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders were imprisoned. In the 1970s, a new phase of protest began, with black trade unions organizing strikes and Steve Biko, leader of the Black Consciousness movement, calling on blacks to defend their African culture. After the Soweto uprising of June 1976, more than 500 black activists, including Biko, were killed by police. In the 1980s, protests continued, and the South African government resorted to strong-arm tactics, using the military and police to suppress opposition to white rule. Thousands of blacks were killed. [PAR] Meanwhile, a black Anglican minister named Desmond Tutu, who in 1975 became the first black dean of St. Mary’s Cathedral in Johannesburg, was emerging as an important leader of the anti-apartheid movement. He advocated nonviolence and successfully pushed for international sanctions against South Africa. In 1984, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

It was a sensation. [PAR] Richard Strauss [PAR] Richard Strauss described his new creation as ‘a musical comedy’. When it exploded on the world to a packed house at the Königliches Opernhaus in Dresden it was a sensation. Some austere critics thought the delectable waltzes were out of place, but audiences adored it and special trains to Dresden had to be laid on for 50 more performances there that year. By the end of 1911 Der Rosenkavalier (‘The Knight of the Rose’) had been staged in Milan, Vienna, Rome and Berlin. Thomas Beecham conducted the British premiere at Covent Garden in 1913. Rosenkavalier has remained Strauss’s best-loved opera and great singers specially associated with it include Lotte Lehmann, Elisabeth Söderström, Felicity Lott and Renée Fleming. [PAR] Hugo von Hofmannsthal’s libretto was based partly on two plays by Molière. From the beginning he planned a major role for a young man to be played and sung by a woman. The ‘man’, Octavian, is the lover of the opera’s principal female character, the aristocratic Marschallin, and the opera’s opening scene finds them in bed together.

A new Alzheimer's mouse study by researchers at the University of South Florida found that this interaction boosts blood levels of a critical growth factor that seems to fight off the Alzheimer's disease process. [PAR] The findings appear in the early online version of an article to be published June 28 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease. Using mice bred to develop symptoms mimicking Alzheimer's disease, the USF team presents the first evidence that caffeinated coffee offers protection against the memory-robbing disease that is not possible with other caffeine-containing drinks or decaffeinated coffee. [PAR] Previous observational studies in humans reported that daily coffee/caffeine intake during mid-life and in older age decreases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The USF researchers' earlier studies in Alzheimer's mice indicated that caffeine was likely the ingredient in coffee that provides this protection because it decreases brain production of the abnormal protein beta-amyloid, which is thought to cause the disease.

In trying to imitate his poet friend, Mario awakens to all the beauty around him and discovers love with the gorgeous local girl, Beatrice Russo.

This leaves Mario in a sad state, but now that he is married, he has other responsibilities to live for. Neruda had awakened in Mario a desire to speak for himself and to seek justice.

Richard Marsh of the Cinque Ports Militia, a mayor of Faversham,       founded a brewery over an artesian well in the town. [PAR] At that time, the town of Faversham was a bustling port and already       enjoyed a brewing tradition dating back to the 12th century when King       Stephen founded a Benedictine abbey just yards from the present brewery       site. It didn't take the Cluniac monks long to discover that Faversham's       pure spring water could be combined with locally-grown malting barley to       produce a particularly fine ale. [PAR] Records indicate that Richard Marsh was a brewer of some size, far removed       from the innkeepers of the town who brewed on their premises. [PAR] When Marsh died around 1727 the brewery,       which by this time included its own maltings, passed to his widow Mary and       eventually to their daughter, Sylvester, who managed the business until       her death aged just 24. [PAR] In 1741 the brewery was acquired by Samuel       Shepherd, a member of a prominent land owning family and already active       for some years in Faversham as a maltster.

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO     [PAR] Kopassus (a portmanteau of "Komando Pasukan Khusus" or "Special Forces Command") is an Indonesian Army special forces group that conducts special operations missions for the Indonesian government, such as direct action, unconventional warfare, sabotage, counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism, and intelligence gathering. Kopassus was founded on April 16, 1952. It is gaining worldwide attention after the successful hostage release operation of Garuda Indonesia Flight 206. [PAR] The Special Forces quickly made their mark by spearheading some of the government's military campaigns: putting down regional rebellions in the late 1950s, the Western New Guinea campaign in 1961-1962, the confrontation with Malaysia from 1962–1966, the massacres of alleged communists in 1965, the East Timor invasion in 1975, and the subsequent campaigns against separatists throughout Indonesia. [PAR] Kopassus is alleged by external media and human rights-affiliated NGOs to have committed violations of human rights in East Timor, Aceh and Papua and the capital Jakarta. Notably in the Western press, published articles in mainstream media may include epithets such as "the notorious Kopassus". [PAR] On April 15, 1952, Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang laid the foundation for Kesatuan Komando Tentara Territorium III/Siliwangi (Kesko TT), the early name of Kopassus.

Only two of these still remain a part of our consciousness today. ‘Double Your Money’ hosted by Hughie Green and ‘Take Your Pick’ hosted by Michael Miles. ‘Take Your Pick’ aired on the second week of ITV and throughout its 13-year run was rarely out of the top ten. It was estimated that the show reached eight million homes throughout the country and on one particular week an audience of twenty-three million viewers was achieved.

When the Second World War broke out he was working as a newsreader in Singapore. He escaped on a cattle-boat just a few days before the colony fell to the Japanese, with his new bride, Joan Shirvill, secretary to the radio station’s programme controller. Michael and Joan spent the rest of the war entertaining troops in Africa, and at the same time he began formulating his idea for a quiz show.

The orphaned Flora must now consider free housing options as she sifts through letters of condolence from relatives. [PAR] She opts for an invitation from her dour cousin, Judith Starkadder (Eileen Atkins), who lives with her family at Cold Comfort Farm in rural Sussex. For Flora, an aspiring writer who intends to learn about "real life," this place sounds very promising. Also, she's curious about a mysterious event that apparently occurred between Robert Poste (her late father) and the Starkadders, causing the family to feel it owes Flora an enormous moral debt. [PAR] The orderly, independent Flora enters a household where gloominess is next to godliness, and where civilization, free-thinking and hygiene are frowned upon. To Flora's request that her dust-laden bedroom drapes be washed, for instance, Judith Starkadder icily replies, "It's been years since such trifles broke across the web of my solitude."

Each of these chefs dreams of fame and fortune, but many soon find their dreams becoming nightmares. Chef Ramsay demands quality and the intensity of the challenges is beyond anything the contestants can ever imagine. Split into two teams, they must compete against each other to provide their very best in the kitchen. If they do, they are lavishly rewarded with everything from extravagant trips to a ride on Ramsay's personal yacht. Those that fail are forced to suffer humiliating punishment. At the end of each episode, the chef who provided the best performance in Ramsay's opinion on the losing team is chosen to select two chefs from their own team for elimination. They must then give their reasons for their selection. Though one of these two chefs may be eliminated, Ramsay is under no obligation to choose either, and the final decision as to who is sent home is made solely by him. From Waffle House chefs to executive chefs, the competitors are tested in every way possible, from leadership skills to culinary skills.

From the 6th to 3rd century BC Bahrain was included in the Persian Empire by the Achaemenids, an Iranian dynasty.  The Greek admiral Nearchus is believed to have been the first of Alexander's commanders to visit the island, and he found a verdant land that was part of a wide trading network; he recorded: “That in the island of Tylos, situated in the Persian Gulf, are large plantations of cotton tree, from which are manufactured clothes called sindones, a very different degrees of value, some being costly, others less expensive. The use of these is not confined to India, but extends to Arabia.”  The Greek historian, Theophrastus, states that much of the islands were covered in these cotton trees and that Tylos was famous for exporting walking canes engraved with emblems that were customarily carried in Babylon.  Ares was also worshipped by the country's indigenous and Greek population.

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO     [PAR] Bus [PAR] Few foreigners arrive in Caracas by bus, but buses run daily from most Venezuelan cities and cover the entire country. The inexpensive buses arrive at the noisy, dirty and dangerous terminal of Nuevo Circo, located in the Caracas city center. [PAR] Airports [PAR] The Simón Bolívar International Airport of Maiquetía is located near the port of La Guiara on the Caribbean coast, approximately 25 kilometers (16 miles) from the Caracas city center. A highway connects the airport with the city. The airport has two terminals: one for national flights (daily to Maracaibo, Mérida, and other major Venezuelan cities), and another for international flights. There are daily flights from Miami (approximately a two-and-a-half-hour flight) and New York (approximately a six-and-a-half-hour flight) and many major European cities. The most common U.S. airline with the most routes to Caracas is American Airlines, and the Venezuelan national airlines of Avensa and Aeropostal also offer direct service from Miami. The Maiquetía airport also offers service to most Latin American capitals. There is a frequent bus service from the airport to the city center; travelers may also take taxis or arrange for hotel pick-ups. [PAR] Shipping [PAR] The port of La Guiara is one of the busiest ports in the country, but passenger service is not available. However, several Caribbean cruise lines do make common one-day stops in the Caracas area.

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO     "Daddy," suffice it to say, wasn't trying to rock little Trixie to sleep. This song inspired such variations as "Rock That Thing" by Lil Johnson and "Rock Me Mama" by Ikey Robinson. [PAR] By the 1930s the term had begun to be associated with the idea of music with a good beat to it. In 1931 Duke Ellington did "Rockin' in Rhythm" for Victor. The Boswell Sisters did a song called "Rock and Roll" in the 1934 United Artists flick Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round. In 1939 Buddy Jones recorded "Rockin' Rollin' Mama" (String), in which he soulfully shouted, "I love the way you rock and roll!" But rockin' and rollin' didn't really catch on until 1948, when Wynonie Harris released "Good Rockin' Tonight" (King). An earlier version by Roy Brown (Deluxe, 1947) had bombed, but Wynonie's cover became a number one hit. That was the beginning of a flood of tunes that worked "rock" into the title, such as Bill Haley's "Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie" (1952), which contained the deathless words "Rock, rock, rock, everybody/Roll, roll, roll, everybody." [PAR] In 1952 Alan Freed visited a Cleveland record store and learned that R&B records were being snapped up by white teenagers.

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO     [DOC] [TLE] Falkland IslandsThe Falkland Islands (; ) are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf. The principal islands are about 300 mi east of South America's southern Patagonian coast, at a latitude of about 52°S. The archipelago, with an area of 4700 sqmi, comprises East Falkland, West Falkland and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland. [PAR] Controversy exists over the Falklands' discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times, the islands have had French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain reasserted its rule in 1833, although Argentina maintains its claim to the islands. In April 1982, Argentine forces temporarily occupied the islands. British administration was restored two months later at the end of the Falklands War. Most Falklanders favour that the archipelago remain a UK overseas territory, but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom. [PAR] The population (2,932 inhabitants in 2012) primarily consists of native-born Falkland Islanders, the majority of British descent.

The swallowing reflex is under neural control and is triggered by the presence of a material in the back of the mouth. Food is moved to the stomach by muscle contractions. The cardiac valve is at the end of the esophagus and it prevents food from coming back into the esophagus. The difference is that cows regurgitate so food is not being prevented from coming back into the esophagus. The Stomach’s Role in Digestion: After passing through the esophagus, the feed travels to the animal’s stomach. The stomach is used for mechanical and chemical digestion of feed but it also functions in storing food. The stomach is the major difference between a cow (ruminant) and a pig (nonruminant). A cow’s stomach is composed of the following four compartments: rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In contrast, a pig has a simple monogastric stomach. The main function of the cow’s complex stomach is to allow the animal to use roughages (cellulose) as a source of energy. Microorganisms that are present in the first three stomachs ferment material and provide nutrients otherwise unavailable to the animal.

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO     [PAR] Number 80 on the periodic chart, Mercury is right next to gold.  Alchemists of a previous age commonly associated quicksilver with that precious metal.  The easiest way to get pure mercury is to extract it from the mineral, cinnabar.  Alchemists would heat up a piece of cinnabar (mercury sulfide) and the mercury would seem to simply ooze from the rock.  A demonstration of this process to patrons could help convince them that gold might indeed be manufactured from a bar of lead! [PAR] A fairly dense metal, mercury is 13.6 times heavier than water.  Its density means that heavy objects, which are less dense, can easily float on top of it.  For example a brick or a billiard ball that would plunge to the bottom of a container of water will skim about lightly on a container of mercury.  Mercury in its pure state is seldom found just lying about.   Like water it "evaporates" (though more slowly).  In the air it is much more dangerous than in its liquid state. [PAR] The chemical symbol for mercury is "Hg".  This is derived for the Latin name hydrargyrum or "water silver".  It is not magnetic at all, which means that a spill cannot be cleaned up with a magnet.  Mercury is used in vermillion paint pigment, lighting, batteries and some limited medicines.  Yet mercury does have a serious downside.  It is a poison.[DOC] [TLE] Quicksilver | Define Quicksilver at Dictionary.comQuicksilver |

[PAR] THE RIVER [PAR] Texas and Mexico are divided by 1,254 miles of the Rio Grande, which originates high in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado. The river provided a reliable water supply for indigenous populations, Spanish and Mexican communities, and the predominantly Hispanic and Anglo populations that settled the modern boundary. [PAR] Fed by the spring snowmelt and summer rains, the river flows south through New Mexico, dividing the state in half, providing water to arid lands through historic and modern irrigation systems. [PAR] Puebloans called it P'Osoge, "river of great water," and the Spanish followed its course along the badlands of New Mexico through a stretch they called the Jornada del Muerto, "Journey of Death," as they colonized the Pueblo Indians. [PAR] For centuries, the river has been the life source for the agricultural and historical communities of the Mesilla Valley, one of the oldest irrigated lands in the U.S. The historical region extends from Las Cruces, New Mexico to the communities south of El Paso, where Ysleta, Socorro and San Elizario are among the oldest European settlements in Texas. Around the missions of Corpus Cristi de la Isleta and Nuestra Señora del Socorro, the modern communities were established in 1681 and 1682 following the Pueblo Revolt in northern New Mexico. [PAR] From El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico, the Rio Grande forms Texas' border with Mexico.

The series was first broadcast on 18 March 1996, with Warren Clarke being cast as Dalziel and Colin Buchanan being cast as Pascoe. The series is primarily set in Yorkshire, and "follows the work of two detectives that are thrown together as partners. Complete opposites. Different backgrounds, different beliefs, different styles. They get on each other's nerves. They are embarrassed by each other everyday. But their differences make them a stunningly brilliant crime-solving team." The first three series were entirely based on Hill's novels, as were the first two episodes of series four. However, all subsequent stories, with exception to "Dialogues of the Dead", are stories written exclusively for television, and have not appeared as subsequent novels. The series was produced by BBC Birmingham, and broadcast on BBC One until 22 June 2007, running for a total of twelve series.

[PAR] Nikola Kezic, a professor in the Department of Agriculture at Zagreb University, has been exploring using bees to find landmines since 2007 . Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, and other countries from former Yugoslavia still have around 250,000 buried mines that were left there during the wars of the early 90s. Since the end of the war, more than 300 people have been killed in Croatia alone by the explosives, including 66 de-miners. [PAR] Tracking down the mines can be extremely costly and dangerous. However, by training bees (which are able to detect odors from 4.5 kilometers away) to associate the smell of TNT with sugar, the researchers can create an effective way of identifying the locations of mines. [PAR] Kezic leads a multimillion-pound program sponsored by the EU, called Tiramisu , to detect landmines across the continent.

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO      This results in much smaller, emulsified fat globules that don’t float to the top of the container to form a cream layer.  In addition to the fat micelles, there are also casein micelles.  These are much smaller globs that contain calcium phosphate (CaP) inside.  In an animal, these micelles are meant to carry the CaP to the infant’s stomach. [PAR] Our goal is to get the micelles interacting with each other so that they will coagulate and form a gel (the curds).  We can do this using one of the following methods. [PAR] Enzyme-Mediated Coagulation [PAR] This process involves the use of rennet, which is used to make most cheeses.  Rennet can be composed of one or more proteases, including pepsin, chymosin, and proteses derived from microbes such as Mucor miehei.  When they are added to the milk, they begin to break up the portions of the casein protein that sticks out of the micelle surface.  These portions of the protein are what keeps the the hydrophobic micelles floating around in the milk.  When they are removed, the micelles become incredibly unstable.  The only way for them to stabilize is to start interacting with each other, thereby reducing the amount of the micelle that is exposed to the rest of the milk.  This forms a gel matrix “net” which traps all the very large fat globules floating around.  If properly done, the whey will be almost perfectly clear and all the curds will form a mass that floats at the top

2025-04-08 23:14:57 INFO     [DOC] [TLE] Punic Wars - CrystalinksPunic Wars - Crystalinks [PAR] Punic Wars [PAR] The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage from 264 BC to 146 BC. At the time, they were probably the largest wars that had ever taken place, much like today's World Wars. The term Punic comes from the Latin word Punicus (or Poenicus), meaning "Carthaginian", with reference to the Carthaginians' Phoenician ancestry. [PAR] The main cause of the Punic Wars was the fight of interests between the existing Carthaginian Empire and the expanding Roman Republic. The Romans were initially interested in expansion via Sicily (which at that time was a cultural melting pot), part of which lay under Carthaginian control. At the start of the first Punic War, Carthage was the dominant power of the Western Mediterranean, with an extensive maritime empire, while Rome was the rapidly ascending power in Italy, but lacked the naval power of Carthage. [PAR] By the end of the third war, after more than a hundred years and the loss of many hundreds of thousands of soldiers from both sides, Rome had conquered Carthage's empire and completely destroyed the city, becoming the most powerful state of the Western Mediterranean.

There are 100 tiles total. [PAR] Full Answer [PAR] In Scrabble, players earn points by making words. Each letter is worth a specific number of points, and there are special squares on the board that increase the value of letters or words that are placed on those squares. The most common letters are worth the least amount of points. [PAR] For example, all of the letters that have four or more tiles in the game are worth only one point. The letter D is the only exception to this rule, and D is worth two points. The rarest letters in the game are J, K, Q, X and Z, and these letters are worth 8, 5, 10, 8 and 10 points respectively.

If you are interested in a refreshing tropical cocktail that reminds you of that beach vacation you have been thinking about, then make this cocktail, close your eyes and take a sip. [PAR] History [PAR] There are four different theories as to the origin of the piña colada. The most accepted theory came from 1954 in The Caribe Hilton, San Juan Puerto Rico. Ricardo Garcia was a bartender serving Coco Locos which is a mix drink that contains coconut juice, rum, and cream of coconut, this cocktail was served in a fresh coconut. One day the coconut-cutters went on a union strike, which left Don Ricardo

It            was an oversquare design, reducing piston travel per revolution, cutting            down on wear, allowing higher revs, and able to be made relatively smaller            and lighter.
