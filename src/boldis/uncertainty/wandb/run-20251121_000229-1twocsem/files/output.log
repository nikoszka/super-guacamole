Context: ” [PAR] John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning home from a transfer session at a midtown Manhattan recording studio at approximately 10:50 p.m. on this day in 1980, when they exited their limousine onto the West 72nd Street sidewalk just outside their apartment building, the now-famous Dakota. On nearly the same spot some six hours earlier, Lennon had signed his autograph on a copy of his new album, Double Fantasy, for the man who would soon shoot him dead: Mark David Chapman. In his statement to the authorities later that evening, the 25-year-old Chapman, whom police took into custody peaceably after finding him reading a copy of The Catcher in the Rye at the site of the shooting, said, “I’m sure the large part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil.” [PAR] A worldwide outpouring of grief and tribute followed John Lennon’s assassination, culminating in a 10-minute silent vigil on December 14 that saw some 100,000 people gather in New York’s Central Park and tens of thousands of others in cities around the world. Of Chapman, who pled guilty to Lennon’s killing and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison, Yoko Ono would later say, “I don’t even want to think about him, and I usually don’t.
Question: In which city was John Lennon murdered?

Context: According to Groucho, when Shean visited he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he knocked at the door, he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them. [PAR] Minnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career, but had intense ambition for her sons to go on stage like their uncle. While pushing her career eldest son (Chico Marx) in piano lessons, she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Even though Julius's early career goal was to be a doctor, the family's need for income forced Julius out of school at the age of twelve. By that time, Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of Horatio Algar. Throughout the rest of his life, Marx would overcome his lack of formal education by becoming a very well-read. [PAR] After a few unsuccessful stabs at entry-level office work and other jobs suitable for adolescents. Julius took to the stage as a boy singer in 1905. Though he reputedly claimed that as a vaudevillian he was "hopelessly average" it was merely a wisecrack. By 1909, Minnie Marx successfully in Nacogdoches, Texas, Julius, Milton and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers.
Question: What was Groucho Marx's real first name?

Hells Angel Alan Passaro attacked Hunter , stabbing him several times with a knife as the Stones finished “Under My Thumb.” [PAR] The incident was captured on film by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, who created the concert documentary, “ Gimme Shelter .” The footage shows Hunter, at stage left, fighting with a group of Hells Angels and holding a gun; Passaro sees the gun from his position near center stage and attacks Hunter.

[PAR] The sicilian Honoured Society has had lots of names during its life, from "Beati Paoli", the seventeenth century sect which some expert refer to as the mafia ancestor, to Cosa Nostra, the modern organization of this century. [PAR] When at the ending of the 1800s a lot of Sicilians began to emigrate to the United States, "men of honour" created branches of the mafia there; but while in Sicily the mafia was still a rural and archaic organization, in the new country it perfectly adapted itself to the local background and grew up into a real criminal enterprise.

Six days later, he identified the second Martian moon,  Phobos . [PAR] The existence of the moons had been suggested years before, when  Johannes Kepler  proposed that since Earth hosted one moon and Jupiter four (as only the  Galilean moons  were known at the time), Mars might have two moons in orbit around it.

Nitric acid is also commonly used as a strong oxidizing agent. [PAR] Physical and chemical properties [PAR] Commercially available nitric acid is an azeotrope with water at a concentration of 68% HNO3, which is the ordinary concentrated nitric acid of commerce. This solution has a boiling temperature of 120.5 °C at 1 atm.

The droppings contain seeds that sprout roots into the tree branch. The birds also help spread the seed by wiping their beaks on the tree bark to clean off the sticky seeds after they've eaten. The seeds are sticky because of the juice inside the berry. This stickiness helps the seeds stay in the tree rather than falling to the ground.

If you have mistletoe in your house this holiday season, be sure that it is in a place where children and pets won't be able to get to it. [PAR] Spreading the Seed [PAR] The red-and-white berries that grow on mistletoe are eaten by birds that eventually leave their droppings at their favorite hang-out spot -- on a tree branch. The droppings contain seeds that sprout roots into the tree branch. The birds also help spread the seed by wiping their beaks on the tree bark to clean off the sticky seeds after they've eaten. The seeds are sticky because of the juice inside the berry. This stickiness helps the seeds stay in the tree rather than falling to the ground. Within six weeks, the mistletoe plant begins growing, although it takes five years to flower.

Aridity is not a matter of precipitation alone but is defined by the relationship between the precipitation input to the soil in which the plants grow and the evaporative losses. Since evaporation is difficult to evaluate and is not a conventional measurement at meteorological stations, Köppen was forced to substitute a formula that identifies aridity in terms of a temperature-precipitation index (that is, evaporation is assumed to be controlled by temperature). Dry climates are divided into arid (BW) and semiarid (BS) subtypes, and each may be differentiated further by adding a third code, h for warm and k for cold.

[PAR] Indira Gandhi (1917-1984) was the only child of Kamla           and Jawaharlal Nehru. She spent part of her childhood in Allahabad, where           the Nehrus had their family residence, and part in Switzerland, where           her mother Kamla convalesced from her periodic illnesses. She received           her college education at Somerville College, Oxford.

2025-11-21 00:07:53 INFO     context:       She was assassinated                in 1984. [PAR] Indira Gandhi (1917-1984) was the only child of Kamla           and Jawaharlal Nehru. She spent part of her childhood in Allahabad, where           the Nehrus had their family residence, and part in Switzerland, where           her mother Kamla convalesced from her periodic illnesses. She received           her college education at Somerville College, Oxford. A famous photograph           from her childhood shows her sitting by the bedside of Mahatma Gandhi,           as he recovered from one of his fasts; and though she was not actively           involved in the freedom struggle, she came to know the entire Indian political           leadership. After India's attainment of independence, and the ascendancy           of Jawaharlal Nehru, now a widower, to the office of the Prime Minister,           Indira Gandhi managed the official residence of her father, and accompanied           him on his numerous foreign trips. She had been married in 1942 to Feroze           Gandhi, who rose to some eminence as a parliamentarian and politician           of integrity but found himself disliked by his more famous father-in-law,           but Feroze died in 1960

One of our earliest life forms, after many       millions of years, it found itself quite comfortable in what we       know today as the Pyefleet Channel in Essex. There it thrived,       feeding off the nutritious contents of the salt waters of this       region, until it was subjected to a rude awakening by a less       ancient life form, homo erectus and later still, homo sapiens,       Man!

The starfish wraps       its limbs round the shell and maintains a relentless pull upon       it until the exhausted oyster is forced to open. The limpet       bores a hole through the shell.

On the day of the race he was a 100-1 outsider but the day before he had a 500-1 chance!

Discreetly defended by arrowloops, the building had gilded window bars and painted sculpture on its exterior. Edward’s royal barge could be moored beneath the great archway, built using cutting edge Crusader castle-construction technology gleaned from the King’s time fighting in the Holy Land.” (p. 21) [PAR] In addition the guide states that “the timber framing above the archway is a memento of happy times for Anne Boleyn. It was constructed in 1532 by Henry VIII’s Master Carpenter, James Nedeham, as part of the excited rush to renovate the Tower ready for Anne’s coronation in June 1533” (p.

It is often considered as a rough sport,  with slashes and intense checks to the stick and body. The head of the lacrosse stick is strung with loose mesh designed to catch and hold the lacrosse ball. Offensively, the objective of the game is to score by shooting the ball into an opponent's goal past the goalie, using the lacrosse stick to catch, cradle, and pass the ball to do so. Defensively, the objective is to keep the other team from scoring and to gain the ball through the use of stick checking and body contact or positioning. The sport has four major types: men's field lacrosse, women's lacrosse, box lacrosse and intercrosse. The sport consists of four positions: midfield, attack, defense and goalie. In field lacrosse, attackmen are solely offensive players (except on the "ride", when the opposition tries to bring the ball upfield and attackmen must stop them), defensemen or defenders are solely defensive players (except when bringing up the ball, which is called a "clear"), the goalie is the last line of defense, directly defending the goal, and midfielders or "middies" can go anywhere on the field and play offense and defense, although in higher levels of lacrosse there are specialized offensive and defensive middies.

The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer,  with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world.  [PAR] Etymology and pronunciation [PAR] The name "Nevada" comes from the Spanish nevada, meaning "snow-covered",  after the Sierra Nevada ("snow-covered mountain range"). [PAR] Native Nevadans pronounce the second syllable of their state name using the vowel of "bad". Many from outside the Western United States pronounce it with the vowel of "father".

State Assemblyman Harry Mortenson proposed a bill to recognize the alternate (quasi-Spanish) pronunciation of Nevada,  though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote.  The native pronunciation is the de facto official one, since it is the one used by the state legislature. The state's official tourism organization, TravelNevada, stylizes the name of the state as "Nevăda", with a breve accent over the a indicating the locally preferred pronunciation  which is also available as a license plate design.
