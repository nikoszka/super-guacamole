Context: ” [PAR] John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning home from a transfer session at a midtown Manhattan recording studio at approximately 10:50 p.m. on this day in 1980, when they exited their limousine onto the West 72nd Street sidewalk just outside their apartment building, the now-famous Dakota. On nearly the same spot some six hours earlier, Lennon had signed his autograph on a copy of his new album, Double Fantasy, for the man who would soon shoot him dead: Mark David Chapman. In his statement to the authorities later that evening, the 25-year-old Chapman, whom police took into custody peaceably after finding him reading a copy of The Catcher in the Rye at the site of the shooting, said, “I’m sure the large part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil.” [PAR] A worldwide outpouring of grief and tribute followed John Lennon’s assassination, culminating in a 10-minute silent vigil on December 14 that saw some 100,000 people gather in New York’s Central Park and tens of thousands of others in cities around the world. Of Chapman, who pled guilty to Lennon’s killing and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison, Yoko Ono would later say, “I don’t even want to think about him, and I usually don’t.
Question: In which city was John Lennon murdered?
Answer: new york

Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them. [PAR] Minnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career, but had intense ambition for her sons to go on stage like their uncle. While pushing her career eldest son (Chico Marx) in piano lessons, she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Even though Julius's early career goal was to be a doctor, the family's need for income forced Julius out of school at the age of twelve. By that time, Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of Horatio Algar. Throughout the rest of his life, Marx would overcome his lack of formal education by becoming a very well-read. [PAR] After a few unsuccessful stabs at entry-level office work and other jobs suitable for adolescents. Julius took to the stage as a boy singer in 1905. Though he reputedly claimed that as a vaudevillian he was "hopelessly average" it was merely a wisecrack. By 1909, Minnie Marx successfully in Nacogdoches, Texas, Julius, Milton and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers.
Question: What was Groucho Marx's real first name?
Answer: julius

Context:  However the Germans dug themselves very deep, and when the artillery stopped the Germans came out of their trenches and served the British massive casualties using grenades and machine guns.  The British suffered 60,000 casualties including more then 20,000 deaths on July 1.  The battle ended on November 17, and the British had only captured six and a half miles of land; both sides suffered about a total of 1,000,000 casualties.  This battle shows how trench warfare is very devastating to both sides of the war. [PAR] February 29, 2012 at 7:30 PM [PAR] The British Fourth Army and the German Army fought The Battle of Somme from July 1st, 1916 to November 17th, 1916. The plan the British came up with was to first destroy German defenses with massive artillery bombardments on the East side of Germany. Second, 100,000 soldiers would invade the destroyed German positions. Third, two calvary divisions would be sent into Germany to finish them off. The British commander made the mistake of telling the people, "they could advance with sloped arms, smoking their pipes, and come to no harm" which made the British soldiers relax a little more. When the British were not expecting it and they thought all the Germans had been killed the Germans came out mowed down the approaching British. Just on the first day of the battle, July 1st, the British suffered about 60,000 casualties including more than 20,000 deaths.
Question: Which 1st World War battle of 1916 saw 60,000 British casualties on the first day? The battle lasted from July to November, resulting in a British advance of 12 kilometres.

Context: When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood.

The earliest blood transfusions involving human subjects were carried out almost simultaneously in France and England in 1667. Unlike modern transfusion, these first experiments

2025-11-06 08:40:19 INFO     context:       When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth. During the course of the century, transfusion was applied as a remedy to different kinds of sicknesses and injuries, and performed at different times with various fluids.

To cure pathologies of the blood was thus no longer exclusively a matter of stimulating or preventing its evacuation; now the goal was to affect blood’s circulation within the body and its interaction with other organs. The earliest blood transfusions involving human subjects were carried out almost simultaneously in France and England in 1667. Unlike modern transfusion, these first experiments

Context: thefreedictionary.com/Christmas+goat [PAR] Yule Goat [PAR] Joulupukki, Julbock, Julbukk, Klapparbock [PAR] In Norway and Sweden the goat, rather than the reindeer, symbolizes Christmas and brings Christmas gifts. In Sweden straw goats constitute a staple Christmas decoration (see also Yule Straw), while in Norway the animal lends its name to a Christmas Day caroling custom. [PAR] Origins and History [PAR] Some authors contend that the Yule goat originated in pre-Christian Yule celebrations. They believe that the ancient Scandinavians dedicated their Yule festival to the god Thor, whose companion animal was the goat. According to legend, this Norse god rode in a chariot pulled by two billy goats. Others view the Yule goat as a medieval invention. They argue that the goat typically accompanied the Devil in medieval folk plays performed around Christmas time. [PAR] In medieval times the Yule goat frolicked at the center of Scandinavian Christmas festivities. Using a goat skin and head as a costume, two men would masquerade as a goat, sometimes with a third sitting astride them. Such displays and the raucous revelry that accompanied them alarmed Church authorities. In the sixteenth century they began to issue prohibitions against these kinds of events. Nevertheless, groups of young people in Sweden maintained the goat as a sort of mascot when they caroled and danced for their neighbors around Christmas time. In the eighteenth century the goat adopted a new Christmas role in Sweden: gift bringer.

Context: Even people who can palm a basketball sometimes lose their grip when dunking, so you need to get a feel for maneuvering the ball and controlling it in the air. [PAR] Practice running at the rim and slamming the ball against it. Even if you're not "dunking," you're still practicing your approach and holding the ball correctly as you leap toward the hoop. [PAR] You can try a tennis ball or golf ball first, then a volleyball, and work your way up to a basketball. [PAR] 4 [PAR] Land correctly. It's common to focus all your energy on getting the rock in the hole and end up falling on your butt, which hurts. A lot. It happens, even to the pros, but spend some time completing the follow-through and focusing on completing the entire sequence of moves, landing safely, and you'll dunk more accurately and more consistently. [PAR] Visualize the successful dunk and immediately focus on your landing. Try to land on both feet, cushioning your legs and flexing into the landing. Watch out for other players. [PAR] Don't hang on the rim. In most games, hanging on the rim isn't allowed unless you're in danger of landing on someone below you, but hanging on the rim can damage the hoop, and also throw you off balance, pulling your legs out from under you so you fall backwards. So don't try to grab the rim after you've slammed the ball, just dunk it and drop.

Context: Stewarts, Watsonians and  Carlisle were invited in 1893. [PAR] The next development was for tournaments to be run out-with the Borders.  Four border clubs were invited in the month of June to inaugurate St.  George's tournament, which Melrose won, and in 1909 and 1910 Edinburgh  Institution and from 1910 to 1914 Newington, a junior club, ran  tournaments. [PAR] After the 1914-1918 war there was further expansion, locally and  nationally. The Selkirk Sports began in 1919, Kelso in 1920 and Earlston  and Peebles in 1923. There were now eight Border Sports falling into  the Spring Sevens and the Autumn Sevens, each match of the series being  played on fixed Saturdays. [PAR] In 1920 the Royal High School ran a tournament in the Scottish Rugby  Union's field in Edinburgh to aid a War Memorial Fund. This objective  promoted Edinburgh Institution in 1921 and Kelvinside Academicals in  1922 to stage tournaments. The Edinburgh Borderers began their  tournament at Granton in 1922. On 21st February, 1923, several Edinburgh  Clubs met and decided to stage a tournament on 7th April in aid of an  Edinburgh Charity. Thus began the Infirmary Sevens. Other Clubs, East  and West, North and South, introduced tournaments. The climax was  reached in 1973 when the first International Tournament was held at  Murrayfield ninety years after the first tournament in Melrose.

2025-11-06 08:40:37 INFO     context:       Stewarts, Watsonians and  Carlisle were invited in 1893. [PAR] The next development was for tournaments to be run out-with the Borders.  Four border clubs were invited in the month of June to inaugurate St.  George's tournament, which Melrose won, and in 1909 and 1910 Edinburgh  Institution and from 1910 to 1914 Newington, a junior club, ran  tournaments. [PAR] After the 1914-1918 war there was further expansion, locally and  nationally. The Selkirk Sports began in 1919, Kelso in 1920 and Earlston  and Peebles in 1923. There were now eight Border Sports falling into  the Spring Sevens and the Autumn Sevens, each match of the series being  played on fixed Saturdays. [PAR] In 1920 the Royal High School ran a tournament in the Scottish Rugby  Union's field in Edinburgh to aid a War Memorial Fund. This objective  promoted Edinburgh Institution in 1921 and Kelvinside Academicals in  1922 to stage tournaments. The Edinburgh Borderers began their  tournament at Granton in 1922. On 21st February, 1923, several Edinburgh  Clubs met and decided to stage a tournament on 7th April in aid of an  Edinburgh Charity. Thus began the Infirmary Sevens. Other Clubs, East  and West, North and South, introduced tournaments. The climax was  reached in 1973 when the first International Tournament was held at  Murrayfield ninety years after the first tournament in Melrose.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] MadagascarMadagascar ( ; ), officially the Republic of Madagascar (; ), and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. [PAR] The first archaeological evidence for human foraging on Madagascar dates to 2000 BC. Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and AD 550 by Austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from Borneo. These were joined around AD 1000 by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub-groups of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands. [PAR] Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances.

Context: Oor Wullie Annual Gallery. Oor Wullie. Oor Wullie is a Scottish comic strip published in the D.C. [PAR] Thomson newspaper The Sunday Post. It features a character called Wullie, the familiar Scots nickname for boys named William. Oor Wullie means Our Willie. His trademarks are spiky hair, dungarees and an upturned bucket, which he often uses as a seat - most strips since early 1937 begin and end with a single panel of Wullie sitting on his bucket. The earliest strips, with little dialogue, ended with Wullie complaining ("I nivver get ony fun roond here! ").  Characters and story[edit] Wullie, his full name is William MacCallum, home town is unnamed in the original Watkins strips, but it has been called Auchenshoogle since the late 1990s. [PAR] Wullie's age has not been consistent, in the early Watkins scripts he looked about 5 or 6, in later Watkins scripts he looked about 10 or 11, more recently he has become slightly younger.  Annuals[edit] Since 1996 - the 60th anniversary of the strip - D.C.  See also[edit] References[edit] Overview of Oor Wullie. Scottish Poetry Selection - Oor Wullie. Oor Wullie (1936-) "Guid night, sleep tight, An' dinna let the bugs bite! [PAR] An' dinna miss oor wee mite In yer Sunday Post... a'right? " Indecipherable to many southerners, but an icon to those north of the border, that young Scottish loon Wullie has been scuffing around the backstreets of Dundee since 1936.

The hexagonal form of the atmospheric ice crystals, their varying size and shape notwithstanding, is an outward manifestation of an internal arrangement in which the oxygen atoms form an open lattice (network) with hexagonally symmetrical structure. According to a recent internationally accepted classification, there are seven types of snow crystals: plates, stellars, columns, needles, spatial dendrites, capped columns, and irregular crystals. The size and shape of the snow crystals depend mainly on the temperature of their formation and on the amount of water vapour that is available for deposition.

Context: Also arriving in  1892 were Antonius Dvorac – famous composer and Rudyard Kipling – writer  and poet best known for his work The Jungle Book. [PAR] In 1897, Moses Teichman arrived.

Who can  forget the ads of the weak man getting sand kicked in his face and then  getting the Charles Atlas course to build up his muscles (and self  esteem.) Angelo arrived in America in 1903. A few years after him, in  1905, Johann Weissmuller (a.k.a. Johnny Weissmuller) arrived in America.  Johnny is best known as Tarzan but he was also an Olympian swimmer – having won five gold medals and one bronze medal in the 1920s. [PAR] On the lighter side, Henry (Henny) Youngman arrived in 1906. He was a  famous comedian best known for his line: “Take my wife—please” a line  that is still often quoted today in comedic circles.

His name was derived from his elder brother Giovanni, a pawnbroker, who was called Il Botticello ("The Little Barrel"). [PAR] Another Florentine artist from the fifteenth century with a colorful last name was Giuliano Bugiardini, which literally means "little liars." Maybe his family was known for their story–telling skills. There are many other richly imagined, descriptive Italian last names, such as Torregrossa (big tower), Quattrochi (four eyes), Bella (beautiful), and Bonmarito (good husband). [PAR] Mr. Smith [PAR] Some Italian last names are related to a person's occupation or trade. Domenico Ghirlandaio, an Early Renaissance painter noted for his frescoes, probably had an ancestor who was a gardener or florist (the word ghirlanda means wreath or garland). Another Florentine painter, also famous for his frescoes, was known as Andrea del Sarto, but his real name was Andrea d'Agnolo di Francesco. His moniker del sarto (of the tailor) was derived from his father's profession.

Context: [PAR] Using detailed measurements of the path of planets kept by Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) determined that planets traveled around the sun not in circles but in ellipses. In so doing, he calculated three laws involving the motions of planets that astronomers still use in calculations today. [PAR] Galileo Galilei is credited with discovering the first four moons of Jupiter. [PAR] Credit: NASA [PAR] Born in Italy, Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) is often credited with the creation of the optical telescope, though in truth he improved on existing models. The astronomer (also mathematician, physicist and philosopher) turned the new observational tool toward the heavens, where he discovered the four primary moons of Jupiter (now known as the Galilean moons), as well as the rings of Saturn. Though a model of the Earth circling the sun was first proposed by Copernicus, it took some time before it became widely accepted. Galileo is most widely known for defending the idea several years after Kepler had already calculated the path of planets, and Galileo wound up under house arrest at the end of his lifetime because of it. [PAR] Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) proposed the earliest theory about the nature of light, a phenomena that puzzled scientists for hundreds of years. His improvements on the telescope allowed him to make the first observations of Saturn's rings and to discover its moon, Titan. [PAR] Building on the work of those who had gone before him, English astronomer Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is most famous for his work on forces, specifically gravity. He calculated three laws describing the motion of forces between objects, known today as Newton's laws. [PAR] Famed

This new state based on ungodly principles was to be later considered as the Reign of terror. Along with the King, Marie Antionette was also to be beheaded on the Guillotine during this time period.

This absolute dictatorship was an outlaw to orthodox Christianity as it was based on atheistic principles which sought to enforce communist laws in the country. The new religion of France was a weird philosophy centering around a supreme being which was founded by Robespierre himself. This was done to give the public a taste of spirituality in what was otherwise a totally atheistic movement.

[PAR] A Honor Society of Nursing (STTI) answered [PAR] Hyposmia is usually the result of an underlying condition. Treating the underlying cause of hyposmia is often sufficient to treat the hyposmia. [PAR] Hyposmia often affects the sense of taste, since taste and smell are so closely interlinked. If your hyposmia has damaged your sense of taste, you can make your food more appealing by using flavorful herbs and spices to season it, and by eating food in a variety of textures and colors. Butter, cheese, olive oil, toasted nuts, and bacon bits can be used if your diet permits it. The psychiatric effects of hyposmia include depression, but counseling can help you cope with losing your sense of smell.[DOC] [TLE] Smell & The Nervous System - The Five Senses - Healthy ...Smell & The Nervous System - The Five Senses - Healthy Nervous System - Brain & Nervous System - Sharecare [PAR] Smell & The Nervous System [PAR] A Honor Society of Nursing (STTI) answered [PAR] If your hyposmia is severe and lasts for more than two weeks, you may want to consider seeing your doctor.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] Sheryl Crow on Apple MusicSheryl Crow on Apple Music [PAR] To preview a song, mouse over the title and click Play. Open iTunes to buy and download music. [PAR] Biography [PAR] Sheryl Crow's fresh, updated spin on classic roots rock made her one of the most popular mainstream rockers of the '90s. Her albums were loose and eclectic on the surface, yet were generally tied together by polished, professional songcraft. Crow's sunny, good-time rockers and world-weary ballads were radio staples for much of the '90s, and she was a perennial favorite at Grammy time. Although her songwriting style was firmly anchored to the rock tradition, she wasn't a slave to it -- her free-associative, reference-laden poetry could hardly have been the product of any era but the '90s. Her production not only kept pace with contemporary trends, but sometimes even pushed the envelope of what sounds could be heard on a classicist rock album, especially on her self-titled sophomore effort. All of this made Crow one of the most dependable stars of the decade, and she showed no signs of relinquishing her hard-won success in the new millennium.  Sheryl Suzanne Crow was born February 11, 1962, in Kennett, Missouri.

Context: Actually, Mr. Reed seemed a little muted on this occasion, and was thus fully matched by Anthony Tamburello as the leeringly evil Grand Inquisitor; Mr. Tamburello is no great shakes as a singer, but he delivers comic dialogue superbly. And Keith Jurosko, in the shorter part of Luiz, made a wonderfully soulful, earnest comic-romantic. [PAR] This is not to say that the other principals were unworthy of notice: Joanna Levy, Paul Tomasko, Richard Holmes, Carol Wolfe, Ellen Scrofani and Cheryl Fenner all had their merits. But greater musical distinction came from the pit, where Albert Bergeret led a nicely tuned, buoyantly idiomatic acount of the score, well played and with stalwart choral singing, as well. [PAR] Mr. Bergeret, who founded this company in 1974, was also responsible for the stage direction, which was crisply managed if sometimes just a touch amateurishly executed. William Fleet Lively was the choreographer; Beverly Bullock and Edmond Felix did the colorful costumes, and Sally Small was credited with the simple lighting scheme. [PAR] Mostly, as director, Mr. Bergeret stuck to tradition, with an occasional fresh touch not seen in every ''Gondoliers'' production (e.g., Inez, the foster mother who unravels - or is it ravels? - the plot at the end, as a violin-playing orchestra member plucked from the pit). The sets, waving wrinkled in the breeze, looked as if they dated from the dawn of time, or at least 1889.

Context: After nine years as a Carmelite religious, having fulfilled various offices such as sacristan and assistant to the novice mistress, and having spent her last eighteen months in Carmel in a night of faith, she died of tuberculosis at the age of 24. Her feast day is on October 1. Thérèse is well known throughout the world, with the Basilica of Lisieux being the second largest place of pilgrimage in France after Lourdes. [PAR] Spirituality  [PAR] The impact of  The Story of a Soul, a collection of her autobiographical manuscripts, printed and distributed a year after her death to an initially very limited audience, was great, and she rapidly became one of the most popular saints of the twentieth century. Pope Pius XI made her the "star of his pontificate".  She was beatified in 1923, and canonized in 1925. Thérèse was declared co-patron of the missions with Francis Xavier in 1927, and named co-patron of France with Joan of Arc in 1944. On October 19, 1997 Pope John Paul II declared her the thirty-third Doctor of the Church, the youngest person, and at that time only the third woman, to be so honored. Devotion to Thérèse has developed around the world.  [PAR] Thérèse lived a hidden life and "wanted to be unknown", yet became popular after her death through her spiritual autobiography. She also left letters, poems, religious plays, prayers, and her last conversations were recorded by her sisters.

Both organizations operated most forcefully in the 1980s and early 1990s, when Peru's government fought a costly war against both insurgencies, but disproportionately the Shining Path. The U.S. State Department identifies Shining Path as a terrorist organization, but Tupac Amaru hasn't been listed as such since 1999. Shining Path had a period of dormancy in the 1990s, but the organization has since resurged, along with the Peruvian cocaine trade. Analysts say the group is small in numbers, but it could gain support in rural areas that have been neglected by the Peruvian government.

Context: Cox’s position as Founding Curator of Photography is supported by a generous gift from the John and Lisa Pritzker Family Fund, a portion of which will also provide discretionary funds for acquisition, publication, exhibition and programming costs for the department of photography.  He will assume his position in September 2010. [PAR] “The Fine Arts Museums have had a long and keen interest in photography,” says Director Buchanan.  “At present, our permanent collection of photography housed within the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts, ranges from hand-tinted daguerreotypes from the mid-19th century to the monumental C-print installation by Gerhard Richter that commands the de Young’s Wilsey Court.  With the hiring of Julian Cox and the founding of our first department dedicated exclusively to photography, the Fine Arts Museums will firmly enshrine the important standing of photography within our curatorial constitution.” [PAR] About Julian Cox [PAR] According to John Pritzker, “Julian’s appointment reflects FAMSF’s deep commitment to incorporating photography as a mainstay of this world class museum. Julian’s arrival also solidifies San Francisco’s standing as one of the preeminent locations in the world for all things photographic.” [PAR] For the past five years, Julian Cox has served as Curator of Photography at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, during which time he has significantly expanded its permanent collection of photographs and enhanced its reputation in the field.

Context: It's the time after WWII in which a poor Italy is still recovering from the devastation and defeat. [PAR] Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet, finds a rustic home in the island. He is the most famous person ever to set foot in there. Mario is in charge for bringing Pablo his packages and mail. An easy friendship develops between them. Like everyone else in the island, Mario is impressed by the foreigner. In trying to imitate his poet friend, Mario awakens to all the beauty around him and discovers love with the gorgeous local girl, Beatrice Russo. [PAR] The film's mood changes right after Pablo Neruda and his wife receive assurances they can go back to their native land. This leaves Mario in a sad state, but now that he is married, he has other responsibilities to live for. Neruda had awakened in Mario a desire to speak for himself and to seek justice. [PAR] This is a film totally dominated by the late Italian actor Massimo Troisi, who as Mario, completely captures us by just being a simple soul with no malice. Mr. Troisi is splendid in his take of this poor man who discovers beauty and poetry late in his life. Philippe Noiret, is Pablo Neruda. Mr. Noiret makes a great contribution as the man who sees beauty everywhere and translates it into poetry. Maria Grazia Cucinotta is the beautiful Beatrice, the woman who loves Mario. Renato Scarpa and Linda Moretti, play minor roles with success.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] Chess piece hierarchyChess piece hierarchy [PAR] Chess piece hierarchy [PAR] previous next [PAR] Piece hierarchy [PAR] You probably know by now that on the chess board there are  6 types of pieces, each one moving and capturing according to different rules. The value of a  piece is given by its ability to capture other pieces and by its importance for the game. [PAR] A piece's ability to capture other pieces is given by its mobility, or range  of action, in other words by the number of squares on which the piece could  move on. From this point of view the queen is the most powerful piece on the board  because it has the biggest range of action. [PAR] But although the queen is the strongest piece it is not the most important. The most  post important piece on the chess board is the king because the entire game revolves  around checking the opponent's king. [PAR] Many beginners make the false assumption that the value of a piece remains constant  throughout the game. That is not true. The fact is that the value of the piece depends  a lot on the surrounding pieces and their position. The more pieces there are on the board  the more limited they are in their movement. Because the number of pieces decreases  throughout the game the mobility of most remaining pieces increase and thus, so does their value.

Context: [PAR] Neptune was to be recorded several more times, without being recognised as a planet, over the following years. Lalande (1732-1807), a French astronomer whose tables of the planetary positions were the most accurate until the 19th Century, recorded Neptune on the 8th and 10th of May 1795 without recognising that it was not a star. John Herschel , who we shall see in a moment was to be involved with the discovery of Neptune, recorded Neptune on 14 July 1830 believing it to be a star. [PAR] Von Lamont (1805-1879), a Scottish born astronomer who lived most of his life in Munich, is famed for his determination of the orbits of moons of Saturn and Uranus, and also for discovering the periodic fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field. He recorded Neptune on at least three occasions, namely on 25 October 1845, 7 September 1846 and 11 September 1846. As a highly skilled observer, one might have expected that von Lamont would have recognised the motion of Neptune over the four day period. However he failed to do so, only days before Neptune was discovered. [PAR] The discovery of Neptune however did not come from any of these chance observations. Rather it came from a mathematical analysis of the deviation of Uranus from its predicted orbit. Delambre computed tables of planetary positions Tables du Soleil, de Jupiter, de Saturne, d'Uranus et des satellites de Jupiter published in 1792.

2025-11-06 08:42:55 INFO     context:       [PAR] Neptune was to be recorded several more times, without being recognised as a planet, over the following years. Lalande (1732-1807), a French astronomer whose tables of the planetary positions were the most accurate until the 19th Century, recorded Neptune on the 8th and 10th of May 1795 without recognising that it was not a star. John Herschel , who we shall see in a moment was to be involved with the discovery of Neptune, recorded Neptune on 14 July 1830 believing it to be a star. [PAR] Von Lamont (1805-1879), a Scottish born astronomer who lived most of his life in Munich, is famed for his determination of the orbits of moons of Saturn and Uranus, and also for discovering the periodic fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field. He recorded Neptune on at least three occasions, namely on 25 October 1845, 7 September 1846 and 11 September 1846. As a highly skilled observer, one might have expected that von Lamont would have recognised the motion of Neptune over the four day period. However he failed to do so, only days before Neptune was discovered. [PAR] The discovery of Neptune however did not come from any of these chance observations. Rather it came from a mathematical analysis of the deviation of Uranus from its predicted orbit. Delambre computed tables of planetary positions Tables du Soleil, de Jupiter, de Saturne, d'Uranus et des satellites de Jupiter published in 1792.

Like Shakespeare’s London, though, Vienna is teeming with prostitutes and pimps, and disease is rife.  In the London of Shakeseare’s time building were being demolished to try and control the plague: In the Vienna of the play brothels are being torn down to try and stem venereal disease, and the acting Duke, Angelo has issued a  decree making sex outside of marriage an offence carrying the death penalty.

Of course one of the best parts of this film is that it shows that the soldiers fighting this war weren't monsters, and for me that is a positive thing. The battle scenes are incredible, and very intense and suspenseful. Not flawless, but very close, We Were Soldiers is yet another memorable addition to the war genre.

2025-11-06 08:43:13 INFO     context:       We Were Soldiers is the best Vietnam war film to come along in a long time, and like I've said before, it's a very different one as well. Of course one of the best parts of this film is that it shows that the soldiers fighting this war weren't monsters, and for me that is a positive thing. The battle scenes are incredible, and very intense and suspenseful. Not flawless, but very close, We Were Soldiers is yet another memorable addition to the war genre. A fine film, and may I add also a misunderstood one at that.

Context: [PAR] One sister held office as Chiang Mai mayor; other siblings served as members of parliament. [PAR] However, it's her brother Thaksin's political career that matters most. He was Thailand's prime minister from 2001 to 2006, when the military deposed him in a coup, declared martial law and suspended the constitution. [PAR] Yingluck's critics say Thaksin, who is in self-imposed exile in Dubai, is the one who will be pulling the political strings once she takes office. [PAR] From wealth to wealth [PAR] Yingluck Shinawatra was born June 21, 1967, into one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Chiang Mai. She is the youngest of nine children born to Lert Shinawatra and Yindi Ramingwong, the daughter of a princess. [PAR] While Thaksin, who is 18 years older than Yingluck, was in office, the family fortune — and its influence — grew considerably. Much of the family's money came from its telecommunications businesses, which included Advanced Info Service, the largest mobile phone company in Thailand. [PAR] Yingluck earned an undergraduate degree in political science at Chiang Mai University and a master of arts degree in public administration from Kentucky State University in 1991. After graduating, she went to work at one of the family firms, Shinawatra Directory, Thailand's yellow pages, selling advertisements.

2025-11-06 08:43:50 INFO     context:       [PAR] One sister held office as Chiang Mai mayor; other siblings served as members of parliament. [PAR] However, it's her brother Thaksin's political career that matters most. He was Thailand's prime minister from 2001 to 2006, when the military deposed him in a coup, declared martial law and suspended the constitution. [PAR] Yingluck's critics say Thaksin, who is in self-imposed exile in Dubai, is the one who will be pulling the political strings once she takes office. [PAR] From wealth to wealth [PAR] Yingluck Shinawatra was born June 21, 1967, into one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Chiang Mai. She is the youngest of nine children born to Lert Shinawatra and Yindi Ramingwong, the daughter of a princess. [PAR] While Thaksin, who is 18 years older than Yingluck, was in office, the family fortune — and its influence — grew considerably. Much of the family's money came from its telecommunications businesses, which included Advanced Info Service, the largest mobile phone company in Thailand. [PAR] Yingluck earned an undergraduate degree in political science at Chiang Mai University and a master of arts degree in public administration from Kentucky State University in 1991. After graduating, she went to work at one of the family firms, Shinawatra Directory, Thailand's yellow pages, selling advertisements.

It was constructed in 1532 by Henry VIII’s Master Carpenter, James Nedeham, as part of the excited rush to renovate the Tower ready for Anne’s coronation in June 1533” (p.

Context: [PAR] In the swamps the duo marshals the other animals to take on Madame Medusa (Geraldine Page), who needs the little orphan Penny (Michelle Stacy) to fit into a hole that leads to a cave.  In the cave is located a quantity of jewels, but Madame Medusa is interested only in a huge diamond called the Devil's Eye.  The Rescue Society mice and their swampland friends must overcome Madame Medusa and her aids Mr. Snoops (Joe Flynn) and a pair of alligators, who also frequently play babysitter to Penny. [PAR] Madame Medusa never realizes that the mice and swamp animals are trying to rescue Penny, which makes this movie more interesting to watch.  As happens with many such movies, Madame Medusa's henchmen are cerebrally challenged and the animals are able to plan around them. [PAR] The ending of the movie contains a few surprises, and I found the end interesting.  This movie also nicely sets up the excellent sequel "The Rescuers Down Under." [PAR] The real star of this clever movie is Eva Gabor.  Bob Newhart gets top billing, but Eva was perfect for her role and seems to get the best lines in the movie.  She is clever, funny and fearless as compared to Bernard's timid character.  Only when Miss Bianca is in trouble does Bernard seem to rise to some measure of courage.  There were a variety of other notable characters.

2025-11-06 08:44:09 INFO     context:       Cass's soulful crooning was as much a part of the band's recipe for success as their signature harmonies. Cass embarked on a solo career after the group split in 1971 and in 1974 she was found dead at 32 from a heart attack in a London flat owned by singer Harry Nilsson. Cass would have celebrated her 72nd birthday in September [PAR] Smells like 40-something spirit: : Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain joined a dubious club when he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1994. Dead at the age of 27, he'll forever be listed alongside legends Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix who also died tragically at that same age (Amy Winehouse recently joined the 27 Club). Today, Cobain would be 46 and apparently still sporting plaid flannel shirts [PAR] Bobby Darin found international success after his goofy song Splish Splash became a worldwide hit. The New York native was hugely popular in the 1960s and even starred in feature films alongside Rock Hudson, Gregory Peck, Tony Curtis and Pat Boone. He even helped catapult another singer, Wayne Newton, to stardom. After years of heart problems, Darin died of heart failure at just 37 years old. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Today, Darin would be a ripe old 77 [PAR] Yesterday once more: Karen Carpenter's hypnotic voice and drumming skills helped catapult her to stardom alongside her brother Richard as the group The Carpenters in the 1970s.

Context: Her first TV appearance was a small but notable role as a female mugger in the Only Fools and Horses 1996 Christmas episode Heroes and Villains. She soon landed what may be her best-known role as Tricia Dingle on Emmerdale, which she played from 1998 to 2004. It was announced in late 2003 that Murphy would leave Emmerdale in December 2003, so that she could spend more time with her family and two young children, and her character was duly killed off. [PAR] Following a six-year career break to bring up her family, Murphy appeared in The Royal before winning the part of Eva Strong in Hollyoaks. [PAR] In November and December 2005, Murphy appeared on the ITV reality show I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, finishing second to Carol Thatcher. She was noted for being "scared of everything", and for her sweet persona; as well as embarrassing her husband Harry Kewell with comments such as "he's got a peachy bum".  Murphy presented the ITV spin-off series for series 6 with Phillip Schofield. In November 2007, she presented This Mornings coverage of the seventh series every weekday morning. [PAR] In  2005 and 2006, Murphy presented ITV2's coverage of the British Soap Awards. Murphy hosted Footballers' Cribs for MTV UK and VH1 UK, and was a regular on ITV's Loose Women (2006–2007), returning in 2012 for a single episode to celebrate 40 years of Emmerdale and a further single episode in July 2015.

Context: In fact, many breweries lager their beers, whether theyre making a pale ale or a pilsener. [PAR] What does lagering do to a beer? [PAR] A well-lagered beer is not only going to be clearer (and therefore cleaner-tasting). Its also going to have a more developed set of flavors showing through. You know how if you savor a keg for a few weeks, that last beer looks and tastes so much better than the first one? Thats not just because youre getting sentimental. Its because youve basically been lagering the beer in your fridge the whole time — long enough to reap some of the benefits before its gone. [PAR] Try this at home: Go out and buy two six-packs of a good quality ale. Store one six pack somewhere relatively cool (around 60F), like your basement, where itll stay fresh for a while. Store the second six-pack somewhere much colder — as close as you can get to freezing, without quite getting there. (Probably the very back of your fridge.) [PAR] Leave both six-packs alone for a few weeks, and then do a taste comparison between the two. Odds are, youll be able to see and taste a real difference, with the advantage going to the cold-stored beer.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] Jackie Robinson DayJackie Robinson Day is a traditional event which occurs annually in Major League Baseball, commemorating and honoring the day Jackie Robinson made his major league debut. April 15 was Opening Day in 1947, Robinson's first season in the Major Leagues. Initiated for the first time on April 15, 2004, Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated each year on that day. The festivity is a result of Robinson's memorable career, best known for becoming the first black major league baseball player of the modern era in 1947.  His debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers (today known as the Los Angeles Dodgers) ended approximately eighty years of baseball segregation, also known as the baseball color line, or color barrier. He also was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, remembered for his services with the number 42 jersey. [PAR] The gala is celebrated at varied ballparks by Major League team players.  On that one day, all players, coaches, and managers on both teams, and the umpires, wear #42 on their jerseys.
Question: In which sport is April 15th celebrated as 'Jackie Robinson Day', to remember the day in 1947 when he became the first black player of the modern era?

Context: [PAR] Ad [PAR] Whatever the origins, "e pluribus unum" was adopted by Congress in 1782 as an official motto , along with "annuit coeptis" ("he has approved our undertakings") and "novus ordo seclorum" ("a new order for the ages"). Almost immediately, the phrase was being integrated into design proposals for the Great Seal of the United States, and by 1795, it was also appearing on American currency. Incidentally, American currency was not widely standardized until the middle of the 19th century; prior to this period, banks freely printed their own currency, and shopkeepers also had to accept foreign currency, keeping a formidable table of exchange rates in their heads. [PAR] On the Great Seal of the United States, the phrase appears in the banner held in the beak of the American eagle . The busy eagle is also holding an olive branch and a quiver of arrows in its left and right talons, respectively. The phrase is meant to symbolize the union of the 13 original colonies , and their close relationship with the federal government. Over time, people have also taken "e pluribus unum" to refer to the ethnic diversity in the United States. [PAR] The motto appears on all modern American currency, sometimes along with the eagle and, more often, independently. The Great Seal of the United States is also featured on American passports, government documents, bills that have been signed into law, treaties, and other formal communications from the United States government.

2025-11-06 08:44:36 INFO     context:       [PAR] Ad [PAR] Whatever the origins, "e pluribus unum" was adopted by Congress in 1782 as an official motto , along with "annuit coeptis" ("he has approved our undertakings") and "novus ordo seclorum" ("a new order for the ages"). Almost immediately, the phrase was being integrated into design proposals for the Great Seal of the United States, and by 1795, it was also appearing on American currency. Incidentally, American currency was not widely standardized until the middle of the 19th century; prior to this period, banks freely printed their own currency, and shopkeepers also had to accept foreign currency, keeping a formidable table of exchange rates in their heads. [PAR] On the Great Seal of the United States, the phrase appears in the banner held in the beak of the American eagle . The busy eagle is also holding an olive branch and a quiver of arrows in its left and right talons, respectively. The phrase is meant to symbolize the union of the 13 original colonies , and their close relationship with the federal government. Over time, people have also taken "e pluribus unum" to refer to the ethnic diversity in the United States. [PAR] The motto appears on all modern American currency, sometimes along with the eagle and, more often, independently. The Great Seal of the United States is also featured on American passports, government documents, bills that have been signed into law, treaties, and other formal communications from the United States government.

Context: [PAR] Stats [PAR] Keepmoat Stadium Seating Plan & Where to Sit [PAR] By No machine-readable author provided. Fy2 assumed (based on copyright claims). [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons [PAR] As is the case with most new stadiums, Keepmoat is built in a ‘Bowl Style’, rather than the ‘English Style’ of having a stand on each side of the pitch. Also, as with most multi-purpose stadiums, the stands are named after their geographical locations as opposed to any interesting thing associated with the club. The South Stand is behind one of the goals and welcomes the most vocal Donny supporters, whilst The East Stand contains the club’s family section. Away supporters are usually housed in The North Stand, with The West Stand considered to be the main stand in the ground as it houses the dressing rooms, the players’ tunnel and the dugouts. [PAR] Doncaster Rovers Ticket Prices [PAR] Doncaster don’t categorise their league matches, so the amount you’ll pay for your ticket will be the same whoever the club are up against. They do categorise different parts of the stadium, however, so where about you sit along with who old you are will determine how much you pay to attend a match. The club also do numerous offers such as multi-game packages, family tickets and ‘Quid for a Kid’ deals, so they’re worth keeping an eye out for.
Question: Which football league championship side plays home games at Keepmoat Stadium?

Context: [PAR] A more appropriate slogan for the 21st century might be "Kid tested, parent approved." [PAR] General use [PAR] Google "Kid tested, mother approved," and you may be surprised to see that most of the initial results have nothing to do with the cereal that made the phrase famous. (My favourite of the more modern references is a blog entry wherein someone explains just how much her mother liked her new nosering.) The phrase has become so embedded in Western culture that the first page of Google results has nothing to do with the product that spawned it. Isn't that funny?  [PAR] You could argue that E2 is also kid tested and mother approved. Just think of how many moms have accounts here. Moreover, think of how many parent-child combinations have accounts here.  [PAR] Resources:[DOC] [TLE] 1470: Kix - explain xkcd1470: Kix - explain xkcd [PAR] 1470: Kix [PAR] [ edit ] Explanation [PAR] This comic may be a commentary about the uselessness of brainstorming sessions or the bad ideas that come out of them, as they are often started with the phrase “there are no bad ideas”. As the brainstorming session continues the original meaning of the slogan is lost, much like a game of telephone, and the session becomes less productive. [PAR] The slogan for Kix , "Kid tested, Mother approved," is meant to suggest that children generally enjoy the cereal and their mothers, who are naturally concerned about the health of their children, approve of its ingredients.

2025-11-06 08:44:55 INFO     context:       [PAR] A more appropriate slogan for the 21st century might be "Kid tested, parent approved." [PAR] General use [PAR] Google "Kid tested, mother approved," and you may be surprised to see that most of the initial results have nothing to do with the cereal that made the phrase famous. (My favourite of the more modern references is a blog entry wherein someone explains just how much her mother liked her new nosering.) The phrase has become so embedded in Western culture that the first page of Google results has nothing to do with the product that spawned it. Isn't that funny?  [PAR] You could argue that E2 is also kid tested and mother approved. Just think of how many moms have accounts here. Moreover, think of how many parent-child combinations have accounts here.  [PAR] Resources:[DOC] [TLE] 1470: Kix - explain xkcd1470: Kix - explain xkcd [PAR] 1470: Kix [PAR] [ edit ] Explanation [PAR] This comic may be a commentary about the uselessness of brainstorming sessions or the bad ideas that come out of them, as they are often started with the phrase “there are no bad ideas”. As the brainstorming session continues the original meaning of the slogan is lost, much like a game of telephone, and the session becomes less productive. [PAR] The slogan for Kix , "Kid tested, Mother approved," is meant to suggest that children generally enjoy the cereal and their mothers, who are naturally concerned about the health of their children, approve of its ingredients.

Context:  He exhibited frequently and his work was and remains widely reproduced.  Opinions vary as to the quality of his later work; while some appreciate what they see as its moral and evocative qualities,"he continued to paint brilliantly almost until the end of his life" [1] and "A Piper and a Pair of Nutcrackers" (1864) revealed his old power….and with The Swannery invaded by Eagles (1869) he achieved his last triumph." [2] others feel it is excessively sentimental and anthropomorphic, lacking the realism of his earlier creations; some even feel his work was "marred" by this [3] . [PAR] Christopher Forbes, commenting on Queen Victoria's Favourite Dogs and Parrot, also known as The Royal Pets, said, "While Landseer has not endowed these creatures with specifically human characteristics, as he was to do in many of his most amous (sic) pictures, such as Dignity and Impudence exhibited at the British Institution in 1831 (Tate Gallery), there is a suggestion of the animals' mental activity which makes Landseer's painting quite different from, say, portraits of horses by George Stubbs (1724-1806). The dogs are not only beautiful, but also alert, sensitive, and intelligent; each is shown in a separate position and in an attitude that seems to reflect his own dividual state of mind. . . . The image of "Dash," regally perched on his stool, became a popular needlework subject throughout the balance of Queen Victoria's reign." [4] on 28 December 2008.
Question: In Edwin Landseer's painting, 'Dignity and Impudence', what kind of creatures are depicted?
