Context: ” [PAR] John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning home from a transfer session at a midtown Manhattan recording studio at approximately 10:50 p.m. on this day in 1980, when they exited their limousine onto the West 72nd Street sidewalk just outside their apartment building, the now-famous Dakota. On nearly the same spot some six hours earlier, Lennon had signed his autograph on a copy of his new album, Double Fantasy, for the man who would soon shoot him dead: Mark David Chapman. In his statement to the authorities later that evening, the 25-year-old Chapman, whom police took into custody peaceably after finding him reading a copy of The Catcher in the Rye at the site of the shooting, said, “I’m sure the large part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil.” [PAR] A worldwide outpouring of grief and tribute followed John Lennon’s assassination, culminating in a 10-minute silent vigil on December 14 that saw some 100,000 people gather in New York’s Central Park and tens of thousands of others in cities around the world. Of Chapman, who pled guilty to Lennon’s killing and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison, Yoko Ono would later say, “I don’t even want to think about him, and I usually don’t.

Context: According to Groucho, when Shean visited he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he knocked at the door, he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them. [PAR] Minnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career, but had intense ambition for her sons to go on stage like their uncle. While pushing her career eldest son (Chico Marx) in piano lessons, she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Even though Julius's early career goal was to be a doctor, the family's need for income forced Julius out of school at the age of twelve. By that time, Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of Horatio Algar. Throughout the rest of his life, Marx would overcome his lack of formal education by becoming a very well-read. [PAR] After a few unsuccessful stabs at entry-level office work and other jobs suitable for adolescents. Julius took to the stage as a boy singer in 1905. Though he reputedly claimed that as a vaudevillian he was "hopelessly average" it was merely a wisecrack. By 1909, Minnie Marx successfully in Nacogdoches, Texas, Julius, Milton and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers.
Question: What was Groucho Marx's real first name?

Context: When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth. During the course of the century, transfusion was applied as a remedy to different kinds of sicknesses and injuries, and performed at different times with various fluids. By the 1880s, British doctors had abandoned transfusion with blood in favor of infusion with saline solution; the practice was only again resumed after the recognition of human blood types in the twentieth century. Developments in the practice of transfusion and infusion during the century reflect shifting views of how gender and species identity are embodied, and of relations of affinity and immunity between bodies of different kinds. They also reflect a shift from a vitalist to a mechanist understanding of blood and its function.

[PAR] Visualize the successful dunk and immediately focus on your landing. Try to land on both feet, cushioning your legs and flexing into the landing. Watch out for other players. [PAR] Don't hang on the rim. In most games, hanging on the rim isn't allowed unless you're in danger of landing on someone below you, but hanging on the rim can damage the hoop, and also throw you off balance, pulling your legs out from under you so you fall backwards. So don't try to grab the rim after you've slammed the ball, just dunk it and drop.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] MadagascarMadagascar ( ; ), officially the Republic of Madagascar (; ), and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. [PAR] The first archaeological evidence for human foraging on Madagascar dates to 2000 BC. Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and AD 550 by Austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from Borneo. These were joined around AD 1000 by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub-groups of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] Sheryl Crow on Apple MusicSheryl Crow on Apple Music [PAR] To preview a song, mouse over the title and click Play. Open iTunes to buy and download music. [PAR] Biography [PAR] Sheryl Crow's fresh, updated spin on classic roots rock made her one of the most popular mainstream rockers of the '90s. Her albums were loose and eclectic on the surface, yet were generally tied together by polished, professional songcraft. Crow's sunny, good-time rockers and world-weary ballads were radio staples for much of the '90s, and she was a perennial favorite at Grammy time. Although her songwriting style was firmly anchored to the rock tradition, she wasn't a slave to it -- her free-associative, reference-laden poetry could hardly have been the product of any era but the '90s. Her production not only kept pace with contemporary trends, but sometimes even pushed the envelope of what sounds could be heard on a classicist rock album, especially on her self-titled sophomore effort. All of this made Crow one of the most dependable stars of the decade, and she showed no signs of relinquishing her hard-won success in the new millennium.  Sheryl Suzanne Crow was born February 11, 1962, in Kennett, Missouri.

Context: Actually, Mr. Reed seemed a little muted on this occasion, and was thus fully matched by Anthony Tamburello as the leeringly evil Grand Inquisitor; Mr. Tamburello is no great shakes as a singer, but he delivers comic dialogue superbly.

[PAR] This is not to say that the other principals were unworthy of notice: Joanna Levy, Paul Tomasko, Richard Holmes, Carol Wolfe, Ellen Scrofani and Cheryl Fenner all had their merits. But greater musical distinction came from the pit, where Albert Bergeret led a nicely tuned, buoyantly idiomatic acount of the score, well played and with stalwart choral singing, as well. [PAR] Mr. Bergeret, who founded this company in 1974, was also responsible for the stage direction, which was crisply managed if sometimes just a touch amateurishly executed. William Fleet Lively was the choreographer; Beverly Bullock and Edmond Felix did the colorful costumes, and Sally Small was credited with the simple lighting scheme. [PAR] Mostly, as director, Mr. Bergeret stuck to tradition, with an occasional fresh touch not seen in every ''Gondoliers'' production (e.g., Inez, the foster mother who unravels - or is it ravels? - the plot at the end, as a violin-playing orchestra member plucked from the pit).

Context: Disaster struck when a ventilation valve was jolted open during the re-entry, depressurizing the interior of the ship. Cosmonauts at the time did not wear suits while in flight, so all three men were tragically killed . As a result, several changes were made to the Soviet policy, but they could not be implemented while Salyut 1 remained in orbit. No further trips were made to the station. [PAR] On October 11, 1971, the engines on Salyut 1 fired for the last time, bringing the space station into a lower orbit that would result in its eventual plunge into the Pacific Ocean. But despite its early death, Salyut 1 set the stage for stations to come after. The Soviets continued to put short-term stations into space for several years until they felt they were ready for a long-term project. [PAR] Mir and the ISS [PAR] In 1986, the Soviet Union launched the first components of the space station Mir, which was assembled in orbit over the course of a decade.

Shining Path had a period of dormancy in the 1990s, but the organization has since resurged, along with the Peruvian cocaine trade. Analysts say the group is small in numbers, but it could gain support in rural areas that have been neglected by the Peruvian government.

Context: It's the time after WWII in which a poor Italy is still recovering from the devastation and defeat. [PAR] Pablo Neruda, the Chilean poet, finds a rustic home in the island. He is the most famous person ever to set foot in there. Mario is in charge for bringing Pablo his packages and mail. An easy friendship develops between them. Like everyone else in the island, Mario is impressed by the foreigner. In trying to imitate his poet friend, Mario awakens to all the beauty around him and discovers love with the gorgeous local girl, Beatrice Russo. [PAR] The film's mood changes right after Pablo Neruda and his wife receive assurances they can go back to their native land. This leaves Mario in a sad state, but now that he is married, he has other responsibilities to live for. Neruda had awakened in Mario a desire to speak for himself and to seek justice. [PAR] This is a film totally dominated by the late Italian actor Massimo Troisi, who as Mario, completely captures us by just being a simple soul with no malice. Mr. Troisi is splendid in his take of this poor man who discovers beauty and poetry late in his life. Philippe Noiret, is Pablo Neruda. Mr. Noiret makes a great contribution as the man who sees beauty everywhere and translates it into poetry. Maria Grazia Cucinotta is the beautiful Beatrice, the woman who loves Mario. Renato Scarpa and Linda Moretti, play minor roles with success.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] Chess piece hierarchyChess piece hierarchy [PAR] Chess piece hierarchy [PAR] previous next [PAR] Piece hierarchy [PAR] You probably know by now that on the chess board there are  6 types of pieces, each one moving and capturing according to different rules. The value of a  piece is given by its ability to capture other pieces and by its importance for the game. [PAR] A piece's ability to capture other pieces is given by its mobility, or range  of action, in other words by the number of squares on which the piece could  move on. From this point of view the queen is the most powerful piece on the board  because it has the biggest range of action. [PAR] But although the queen is the strongest piece it is not the most important. The most  post important piece on the chess board is the king because the entire game revolves  around checking the opponent's king. [PAR] Many beginners make the false assumption that the value of a piece remains constant  throughout the game. That is not true. The fact is that the value of the piece depends  a lot on the surrounding pieces and their position. The more pieces there are on the board  the more limited they are in their movement. Because the number of pieces decreases  throughout the game the mobility of most remaining pieces increase and thus, so does their value.
