Maureen Cleave - "We're More popular than Jesus Now" - Beatles Interviews Database [PAR] John Lennon Interview: London Evening Standard, "More Popular Than Jesus" 3/4/1966 [PAR] QUICK MENU [PAR] ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW: [PAR] Reporter Maureen Cleave, a good friend of John Lennon's, wrote a personality article about him that would be published in the March 4th 1966 edition of the London Evening Standard. Cleave's piece was intended to present a portrait of the behind-the-scenes Lennon, and was entitled 'How Does A Beatle Live? John Lennon Lives Like This.' The article contained a number of Lennon musings, remarks and random thoughts from a recent conversation she had with him at his home in Weybridge, including John's personal view of the current state of religion:  "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now. I don't know which  will go first, rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me."

The quote was part of a larger conversation in which Lennon shared his thoughts on religion and the impact of rock 'n' roll on society. The original quote has been taken out of context and misrepresented in various media outlets, which has contributed to a misunderstanding of Lennon's intentions and the controversy surrounding the statement.
