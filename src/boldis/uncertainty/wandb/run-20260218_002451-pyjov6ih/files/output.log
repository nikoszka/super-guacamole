Context: [DOC] [TLE] International Bureau of Weights and MeasuresThe International Bureau of Weights and Measures (), is an international standards organisation, one of three such organisations established to maintain the International System of Units (SI) under the terms of the Metre Convention (Convention du Mètre). The organisation is usually referred to by its French initialism, BIPM. [PAR] The other organisations that maintain the SI system, also known by their French initialisms, are the General Conference on Weights and Measures () (CGPM) and the International Committee for Weights and Measures () (CIPM). [PAR] History [PAR] The BIPM was created on 20 May 1875, following the signing of the Metre Convention, a treaty among 51 nations ().  It is based at the Pavillon de Breteuil in Sèvres, France, a 4.35 ha site (originally 2.52 ha) granted to the Bureau by the French Government in 1876, where it enjoys extraterritorial status,  a status that was clarified by the French decree No 70-820 of 9 September 1970. [PAR] Function [PAR] Under the authority of the Metric Convention, the BIPM helps to ensure uniformity of SI weights and measures around the world.  It does so through a series of consultative committees, whose members are the national metrology laboratories of the Convention's member states, and through its own laboratory work. [PAR] The BIPM carries out measurement-related research. It takes part in and organises international comparisons of national measurement standards and performs calibrations for member states. [PAR] The BIPM has an important role in maintaining accurate worldwide time of day.
Question: The International Bureau of Weights and Measures is based in which European country?
