[PAR] History and Uses: [PAR] Archaeological evidence suggests that people have been using silver for at least 5000 years. Silver can be obtained from pure deposits, from silver ores such as argentite (Ag2S) and horn silver (AgCl), and in conjunction with deposits of ores containing lead , gold or copper . [PAR] Silver and silver compounds have many uses. Pure silver is the best conductor of heat and electricity of all known metals, so it is sometimes used in making solder, electrical contacts and printed circuit boards. Silver is also the best reflector of visible light known, but silver mirrors must be given a protective coating to prevent them from tarnishing.

Context: ” [PAR] John Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, were returning home from a transfer session at a midtown Manhattan recording studio at approximately 10:50 p.m. on this day in 1980, when they exited their limousine onto the West 72nd Street sidewalk just outside their apartment building, the now-famous Dakota. On nearly the same spot some six hours earlier, Lennon had signed his autograph on a copy of his new album, Double Fantasy, for the man who would soon shoot him dead: Mark David Chapman. In his statement to the authorities later that evening, the 25-year-old Chapman, whom police took into custody peaceably after finding him reading a copy of The Catcher in the Rye at the site of the shooting, said, “I’m sure the large part of me is Holden Caulfield, who is the main person in the book. The small part of me must be the Devil.” [PAR] A worldwide outpouring of grief and tribute followed John Lennon’s assassination, culminating in a 10-minute silent vigil on December 14 that saw some 100,000 people gather in New York’s Central Park and tens of thousands of others in cities around the world. Of Chapman, who pled guilty to Lennon’s killing and was sentenced to 20 years to life in prison, Yoko Ono would later say, “I don’t even want to think about him, and I usually don’t.
Question: In which city was John Lennon murdered?
Answer: new york

Context: According to Groucho, when Shean visited he would throw the local waifs a few coins so that when he knocked at the door, he would be surrounded by adoring fans. Marx and his brothers respected his opinions and asked him on several occasions to write some material for them. [PAR] Minnie Marx did not have an entertainment industry career, but had intense ambition for her sons to go on stage like their uncle. While pushing her career eldest son (Chico Marx) in piano lessons, she found that Julius had a pleasant soprano voice and the ability to remain on key. Even though Julius's early career goal was to be a doctor, the family's need for income forced Julius out of school at the age of twelve. By that time, Julius had become a voracious reader, particularly fond of Horatio Algar. Throughout the rest of his life, Marx would overcome his lack of formal education by becoming a very well-read. [PAR] After a few unsuccessful stabs at entry-level office work and other jobs suitable for adolescents. Julius took to the stage as a boy singer in 1905. Though he reputedly claimed that as a vaudevillian he was "hopelessly average" it was merely a wisecrack. By 1909, Minnie Marx successfully in Nacogdoches, Texas, Julius, Milton and Arthur began cracking jokes onstage for their own amusement. Much to their surprise, the audience liked them better as comedians than as singers.
Question: What was Groucho Marx's real first name?
Answer: julius

The article contained a number of Lennon musings, remarks and random thoughts from a recent conversation she had with him at his home in Weybridge, including John's personal view of the current state of religion:  "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now. I don't know which  will go first, rock 'n' roll or Christianity.
