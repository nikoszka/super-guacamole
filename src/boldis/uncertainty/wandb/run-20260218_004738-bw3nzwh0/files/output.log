Context: [DOC] [TLE] International Bureau of Weights and MeasuresThe International Bureau of Weights and Measures (), is an international standards organisation, one of three such organisations established to maintain the International System of Units (SI) under the terms of the Metre Convention (Convention du Mètre). The organisation is usually referred to by its French initialism, BIPM. [PAR] The other organisations that maintain the SI system, also known by their French initialisms, are the General Conference on Weights and Measures () (CGPM) and the International Committee for Weights and Measures () (CIPM). [PAR] History [PAR] The BIPM was created on 20 May 1875, following the signing of the Metre Convention, a treaty among 51 nations ().  It is based at the Pavillon de Breteuil in Sèvres, France, a 4.35 ha site (originally 2.52 ha) granted to the Bureau by the French Government in 1876, where it enjoys extraterritorial status,  a status that was clarified by the French decree No 70-820 of 9 September 1970.

Context:  However the Germans dug themselves very deep, and when the artillery stopped the Germans came out of their trenches and served the British massive casualties using grenades and machine guns.  The British suffered 60,000 casualties including more then 20,000 deaths on July 1.  The battle ended on November 17, and the British had only captured six and a half miles of land; both sides suffered about a total of 1,000,000 casualties.  This battle shows how trench warfare is very devastating to both sides of the war. [PAR] February 29, 2012 at 7:30 PM [PAR] The British Fourth Army and the German Army fought The Battle of Somme from July 1st, 1916 to November 17th, 1916. The plan the British came up with was to first destroy German defenses with massive artillery bombardments on the East side of Germany. Second, 100,000 soldiers would invade the destroyed German positions. Third, two calvary divisions would be sent into Germany to finish them off. The British commander made the mistake of telling the people, "they could advance with sloped arms, smoking their pipes, and come to no harm" which made the British soldiers relax a little more. When the British were not expecting it and they thought all the Germans had been killed the Germans came out mowed down the approaching British. Just on the first day of the battle, July 1st, the British suffered about 60,000 casualties including more than 20,000 deaths.
Question: Which 1st World War battle of 1916 saw 60,000 British casualties on the first day? The battle lasted from July to November, resulting in a British advance of 12 kilometres.
