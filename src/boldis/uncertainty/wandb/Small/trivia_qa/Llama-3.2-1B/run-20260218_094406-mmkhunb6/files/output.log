The organisation is usually referred to by its French initialism, BIPM. [PAR] The other organisations that maintain the SI system, also known by their French initialisms, are the General Conference on Weights and Measures () (CGPM) and the International Committee for Weights and Measures () (CIPM). [PAR] History [PAR] The BIPM was created on 20 May 1875, following the signing of the Metre Convention, a treaty among 51 nations ().  It is based at the Pavillon de Breteuil in Sèvres, France, a 4.35 ha site (originally 2.52 ha) granted to the Bureau by the French Government in 1876, where it enjoys extraterritorial status,  a status that was clarified by the French decree No 70-820 of 9 September 1970.

Context: When it resumed in the nineteenth century, the first trials used human blood. They were conducted by the obstetrician James Blundell, who developed transfusion to treat women suffering from hemorrhage after childbirth.

By the 1880s, British doctors had abandoned transfusion with blood in favor of infusion with saline solution; the practice was only again resumed after the recognition of human blood types in the twentieth century. Developments in the practice of transfusion and infusion during the century reflect shifting views of how gender and species identity are embodied, and of relations of affinity and immunity between bodies of different kinds.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] MadagascarMadagascar ( ; ), officially the Republic of Madagascar (; ), and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), as well as numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. [PAR] The first archaeological evidence for human foraging on Madagascar dates to 2000 BC. Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350 BC and AD 550 by Austronesian peoples arriving on outrigger canoes from Borneo. These were joined around AD 1000 by Bantu migrants crossing the Mozambique Channel from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The Malagasy ethnic group is often divided into 18 or more sub-groups of which the largest are the Merina of the central highlands. [PAR] Until the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances.

[PAR] A piece's ability to capture other pieces is given by its mobility, or range  of action, in other words by the number of squares on which the piece could  move on. From this point of view the queen is the most powerful piece on the board  because it has the biggest range of action.

The most  post important piece on the chess board is the king because the entire game revolves  around checking the opponent's king. [PAR] Many beginners make the false assumption that the value of a piece remains constant  throughout the game. That is not true. The fact is that the value of the piece depends  a lot on the surrounding pieces and their position. The more pieces there are on the board  the more limited they are in their movement. Because the number of pieces decreases  throughout the game the mobility of most remaining pieces increase and thus, so does their value.

Lalande (1732-1807), a French astronomer whose tables of the planetary positions were the most accurate until the 19th Century, recorded Neptune on the 8th and 10th of May 1795 without recognising that it was not a star.

[PAR] Von Lamont (1805-1879), a Scottish born astronomer who lived most of his life in Munich, is famed for his determination of the orbits of moons of Saturn and Uranus, and also for discovering the periodic fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field. He recorded Neptune on at least three occasions, namely on 25 October 1845, 7 September 1846 and 11 September 1846. As a highly skilled observer, one might have expected that von Lamont would have recognised the motion of Neptune over the four day period. However he failed to do so, only days before Neptune was discovered. [PAR] The discovery of Neptune however did not come from any of these chance observations.

Context: In fact, many breweries lager their beers, whether theyre making a pale ale or a pilsener. [PAR] What does lagering do to a beer? [PAR] A well-lagered beer is not only going to be clearer (and therefore cleaner-tasting). Its also going to have a more developed set of flavors showing through. You know how if you savor a keg for a few weeks, that last beer looks and tastes so much better than the first one? Thats not just because youre getting sentimental. Its because youve basically been lagering the beer in your fridge the whole time — long enough to reap some of the benefits before its gone. [PAR] Try this at home: Go out and buy two six-packs of a good quality ale. Store one six pack somewhere relatively cool (around 60F), like your basement, where itll stay fresh for a while. Store the second six-pack somewhere much colder — as close as you can get to freezing, without quite getting there. (Probably the very back of your fridge.) [PAR] Leave both six-packs alone for a few weeks, and then do a taste comparison between the two. Odds are, youll be able to see and taste a real difference, with the advantage going to the cold-stored beer.

Context: [DOC] [TLE] Jackie Robinson DayJackie Robinson Day is a traditional event which occurs annually in Major League Baseball, commemorating and honoring the day Jackie Robinson made his major league debut. April 15 was Opening Day in 1947, Robinson's first season in the Major Leagues. Initiated for the first time on April 15, 2004, Jackie Robinson Day is celebrated each year on that day. The festivity is a result of Robinson's memorable career, best known for becoming the first black major league baseball player of the modern era in 1947.  His debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers (today known as the Los Angeles Dodgers) ended approximately eighty years of baseball segregation, also known as the baseball color line, or color barrier. He also was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962, remembered for his services with the number 42 jersey. [PAR] The gala is celebrated at varied ballparks by Major League team players.  On that one day, all players, coaches, and managers on both teams, and the umpires, wear #42 on their jerseys.

Context: [PAR] Stats [PAR] Keepmoat Stadium Seating Plan & Where to Sit [PAR] By No machine-readable author provided. Fy2 assumed (based on copyright claims). [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons [PAR] As is the case with most new stadiums, Keepmoat is built in a ‘Bowl Style’, rather than the ‘English Style’ of having a stand on each side of the pitch. Also, as with most multi-purpose stadiums, the stands are named after their geographical locations as opposed to any interesting thing associated with the club. The South Stand is behind one of the goals and welcomes the most vocal Donny supporters, whilst The East Stand contains the club’s family section. Away supporters are usually housed in The North Stand, with The West Stand considered to be the main stand in the ground as it houses the dressing rooms, the players’ tunnel and the dugouts. [PAR] Doncaster Rovers Ticket Prices [PAR] Doncaster don’t categorise their league matches, so the amount you’ll pay for your ticket will be the same whoever the club are up against. They do categorise different parts of the stadium, however, so where about you sit along with who old you are will determine how much you pay to attend a match. The club also do numerous offers such as multi-game packages, family tickets and ‘Quid for a Kid’ deals, so they’re worth keeping an eye out for.

[Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons [PAR] As is the case with most new stadiums, Keepmoat is built in a ‘Bowl Style’, rather than the ‘English Style’ of having a stand on each side of the pitch. Also, as with most multi-purpose stadiums, the stands are named after their geographical locations as opposed to any interesting thing associated with the club. The South Stand is behind one of the goals and welcomes the most vocal Donny supporters, whilst The East Stand contains the club’s family section. Away supporters are usually housed in The North Stand, with The West Stand considered to be the main stand in the ground as it houses the dressing rooms, the players’ tunnel and the dugouts. [PAR] Doncaster Rovers Ticket Prices [PAR] Doncaster don’t categorise their league matches, so the amount you’ll pay for your ticket will be the same whoever the club are up against. They do categorise different parts of the stadium, however, so where about you sit along with who old you are will determine how much you pay to attend a match. The club also do numerous offers such as multi-game packages, family tickets and ‘Quid for a Kid’ deals, so they’re worth keeping an eye out for.

Context: 46%. While this may seem like a small percentage, given the length of most Monopoly games it is likely that this will happen at some point to someone during the game. [PAR] Probability of Leaving Jail [PAR] We now turn to the probability of leaving Jail by rolling doubles. This probability is slightly more difficult to calculate because there are different cases to consider: [PAR] The probability that we roll doubles on the first roll is 1/6. [PAR] The probability that we roll doubles on the second turn but not the first is (5/6) x (1/6) = 5/36. [PAR] The probability that we roll doubles on the third turn but not the first or second is (5/6) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 25/216. [PAR] So the probability of rolling doubles to get out of Jail is 1/6 + 5/36 + 25/216 = 91/216, or about 42%. [PAR] We could calculate this probability in a different way. The complement of the event “roll doubles at least once over the next three turns” is “We don’t roll doubles at all over the next three turns.” Thus the probability of not rolling any doubles is (5/6) x (5/6) x (5/6) = 125/216. Since we have calculated the probability of the complement of the event that we want to find, we subtract this probability from 100%. We get the same probability of 1 – 125/216 = 91/216 that we obtained from the other method. [PAR] Probabilities of the Other Methods [PAR] Probabilities for the other

[PAR] The probability that we roll doubles on the third turn but not the first or second is (5/6) x (5/6) x (1/6) = 25/216. [PAR] So the probability of rolling doubles to get out of Jail is 1/6 + 5/36 + 25/216 = 91/216, or about 42%. [PAR] We could calculate this probability in a different way. The complement of the event “roll doubles at least once over the next three turns” is “We don’t roll doubles at all over the next three turns.” Thus the probability of not rolling any doubles is (5/6) x (5/6) x (5/6) = 125/216. Since we have calculated the probability of the complement of the event that we want to find, we subtract this probability from 100%. We get the same probability of 1 – 125/216 = 91/216 that we obtained from the other method. [PAR] Probabilities of the Other Methods [PAR] Probabilities for the other

So on any turn the probability of rolling a double is 6/36 = 1/6. [PAR] Now each roll of the dice is independent . So the probability that any given turn will result in the rolling of doubles three times in a row is (1/6) x (1/6) x (1/6) = 1/216. This is approximately 0.4

[PAR] Early life [PAR] Flynn was born in a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania, where his father, Theodore, was a lecturer (1909) and later professor (1911) of biology at the University of Tasmania.

Context: [PAR] WHEN TO CHIT / SPROUT ESTIMA POTATOES [PAR] We recommend that you start chitting / sprouting Estima potatoes in the third week of February 2017. This will give them four to five weeks to develop healthy sprouts just at the time when they are ready  to be planted out. Keep the potatoes in cool but light conditions to ensure they grow short, green  sprouts. Click here for our page dedicated to  chitting / sprouting potatoes in the UK and Ireland. [PAR] WHEN TO PLANT ESTIMA POTATOES [PAR] Estima potatoes are second earlies potatoes and they are ready for   harvest, if conditions are correct, 15 to 17 weeks after the seed potatoes are planted. The key factor governing the time for planting all potatoes   is the date of the last frost in your area. Even a touch of frost can damage   potato plants if their foliage is above ground, an unexpected severe frost   can kill them completely. [PAR] The date for planting Estima potato seed can be calculated on the   basis that seed potatoes will take four weeks before they appear above ground.   Given also that you want them to appear above ground only when the danger of   frost has passed (the last week of April is the UK average) the last week of March 2017 is about right time to plant them. Planting and care of Estima potatoes has no special   requirements but note that the plants do grow to be relatively tall so a   protected position is best for them.

What is the reason for this? : askscience [PAR]   (0 children) [PAR] So what you're saying is that because it is such a simplistic organ it can easily be repaired by normal cell division? [PAR] Maybe not because of its simplicity but because its function depends merely on its cells receiving blood, and them being connected to the biliary tract. A bladder for example might be a "simple" organ, but hard to rebuild, you would have to reconnect it to the kidneys, reconnect it to nerves, its walls must be build in the right ways, etc. [PAR] Is this similar to the way that skin recovers after trauma (Scrapes, cuts, burns)? Up to a point yes. A big part of skin repair is cell division from the sides on the injury. It also involves some cells migrating, and the scar plays an important role on providing a good medium for it to happen. There is also some retraction and... things I dont remember. I cant make a complete comparison because we dont Ive never studied the liver process in depth.

What is the reason for this? : askscience [PAR]   (0 children) [PAR] So what you're saying is that because it is such a simplistic organ it can easily be repaired by normal cell division? [PAR] Maybe not because of its simplicity but because its function depends merely on its cells receiving blood, and them being connected to the biliary tract. A bladder for example might be a "simple" organ, but hard to rebuild, you would have to reconnect it to the kidneys, reconnect it to nerves, its walls must be build in the right ways, etc. [PAR] Is this similar to the way that skin recovers after trauma (Scrapes, cuts, burns)? Up to a point yes. A big part of skin repair is cell division from the sides on the injury. It also involves some cells migrating, and the scar plays an important role on providing a good medium for it to happen. There is also some retraction and... things I dont remember. I cant make a complete comparison because we dont Ive never studied the liver process in depth.

A tinkerer at heart, he held patents for a grain harvester and a hay raking device, and he set his mind to making an electric carpet sweeper. Using a motor scavenged from a sewing machine to turn a small fan for suction, with a pillow case for a dustbag, a beater-bar cranked by a leather band attached to the fan engine, and a broom handle to push his contraption around the floor, he constructed the first portable electric vacuum cleaner in 1907. [PAR] Spangler's device was not the first vacuum cleaner. Hubert Cecil Booth, a British inventor, had patented the first true vacuum cleaner in 1901, but Booth's machine was gasoline-powered, horse-drawn, and had to be parked in the street, with workers carrying long vacuum hoses into clients' businesses.

Context: [PAR] When world first saw Michael Jackson moonwalk, time all but stopped. A dance move became the single cultural focus around the world. The year was 1984, and Jackson appeared at the Motown 25th Anniversary event at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in support of the ultimate-legend record Thriller. He performed “Billie Jean” – which was then the number one song in the country at the time. But it wasn’t the song people were raving about when the special aired on television.  [PAR] It was arguably the most notable high point in his career, but Michael was initially reluctant to perform at the concert. His label was CBS Records, and producers on the Motown special wanted him to play the old Jackson 5 hits with his brothers – the songs on the Motown label. Agreeing to the medley on the condition of “Billie Jean”’s inclusion, Jackson did his family duty, despite his rapid ascent to icon status as a solo artist. And when it was time for his solo performance, the only song of the night not released by Motown, there was a new electricity to him.  [PAR] The moonwalk came quickly towards the end of “Billie Jean”. Jackson may not have originated the concept (James Brown and others have performed variations in previous years), but he made it his signature move that night with a streak of dancing perfection. The entire world took notice, as the man walked backwards, while gliding across the floor smoothly, as if walking forward.

In 1607, English historian William Camden stated that the tre cassyn were derived from the Sicilian triskelion.

Newton noted that the wife of King Alexander III of Scotland was Henry's daughter, and that Alexander visited the English court in 1255. Later in 1266, Norway ceded the Isle of Man to the Kingdom of Scotland , and Newton considered it likely that Alexander utilised the triskelion for the arms of his new possession.

Alveoli and the cells that support them usually hold your bronchioles open so air can pass through and oxygen can be distributed into your bloodstream.

Context: With the exception of the repeated use of one mild obscenity, MY FAIR LADY is an excellent, enjoyable, entertaining, musical comedy well worth revisiting. [PAR] Review: [PAR] The multiple Oscar-winning MY FAIR LADY is a musical comedy that brings George Bernard Shaw's famous play PYGMALION to the big screen with some wonderful twists and great music. Professor Henry Higgins, a dialect specialist in turn-of-the-century London, claims to a friend that he could raise the social level of anyone simply by altering the manner in which they speak. To test this theory, he selects Eliza Doolittle, a cockney flower girl, and begins to give her elocution lessons. Eliza's transformation into a high society lady is not an easy transition and the experiment produces some unexpected and humorous results. [PAR] This is a charming and delightful musical with a superb range of engaging, character-driven tunes. As should be expected with a musical based on a work by Shaw, Fabian Socialist morality is presented and debated within the movie. However, the storyline of the musical subtly refutes the play's anti-morality arguments and comes down on the side of morality in the end. Moreover, with the exception of the repeated use of one minor obscenity and one minor vulgarity, any other offensive elements are only implied, often refuted and never explicitly shown.

Context: In fact, the acid gets its name from the Latin word butyrum, or “butter,” which is where it was allegedly first discovered and isolated. Butter is generally up to 4 percent acid, and when it spoils hydrolysis breakdown causes it to emit a foul sour smell. The same smell is associated with most any spoiled dairy products. [PAR] Production and Fermentation [PAR] This compound is prepared on a large scale by the fermentation of starch or sugar.  Fermentation uses microorganisms and takes place under conditions where there is no oxygen to transform the glucose in these compounds.  The microbes gain energy from this process.  Less energy is produced than if the compounds were transformed in the presence of oxygen. [PAR] Various species of bacteria also make it as a product of fermentation.  These sorts of bacteria typically thrive in places where there is no oxygen, such as the rumen of cows and goats. The rumen is a special digestive organ that helps with the degradation of plant compounds that would otherwise be extremely difficult to break down. Bacteria within the organ generate butyrate from the plant fibers they consume. This is also one of the main reasons the compound appears in dairy products like milk, butter, and most yogurts. In many cases it is also produced as a side product in some marine sediments.

Context: Spanish occupation lasted over 3 centuries until 1898, when Spain signed a treaty passing control of the Philippines to the United States. Two years after Japanese occupation (1942–44), the Philippines gained independence but inherited 2 major security threats from the communist-led Huk rebels in the north of Luzon and the Moro secessionist rebels in southern Mindanao. The Philippine army finally defeated the Huk rebels in 1954, but the Moro insurgency continued into the 1970s when President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, lasting until 1981, in an attempt to destroy the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari. With material support from Libya the MNLF was able to sustain military campaigns against government troops demanding independence for areas under predominantly Muslim population.

2026-02-18 09:54:25 INFO     context:       Spanish occupation lasted over 3 centuries until 1898, when Spain signed a treaty passing control of the Philippines to the United States. Two years after Japanese occupation (1942–44), the Philippines gained independence but inherited 2 major security threats from the communist-led Huk rebels in the north of Luzon and the Moro secessionist rebels in southern Mindanao. The Philippine army finally defeated the Huk rebels in 1954, but the Moro insurgency continued into the 1970s when President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, lasting until 1981, in an attempt to destroy the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) led by Nur Misuari. With material support from Libya the MNLF was able to sustain military campaigns against government troops demanding independence for areas under predominantly Muslim population.

Context: [PAR] Because Elizabeth was only four years his senior, Edward was naturally closer to her       than to Mary . His letters to       her were warm and affectionate. [PAR] Henry VIII died in 1547 and his nine-year-old son became King Edward VI. A council was appointed       by his father to rule during his minority. But Edward's uncle, the Edward       Seymour, lord Hertford ( Jane Seymour 's brother),       wanted to be Protector of the country and the King.

The geometry of honeycomb structures can vary widely but the common feature of all such structures is an array of hollow cells formed between thin vertical walls. The cells are often columnar and hexagonal in shape. A honeycomb shaped structure provides a material with minimal density and relative high out-of-plane compression properties and out-of-plane shear properties.  [PAR] Man-made honeycomb structural materials are commonly made by layering a honeycomb material between two thin layers that provide strength in tension. This forms a plate-like assembly. Honeycomb materials are widely used where flat or slightly curved surfaces are needed and their high Specific strength is valuable.

Context: Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), affect the energy balance of the global atmosphere in ways expected to lead to an overall increase in global average temperature, known as global warming (see also greenhouse effect ). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , established by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization in 1988, the long-term effects of global warming would include a general rise in sea level around the world, resulting in the inundation of low-lying coastal areas and the possible disappearance of some island states; the melting of glaciers , sea ice , and Arctic permafrost ; an increase in the number of extreme climate -related events, such as floods and droughts , and changes in their distribution; and an increased risk of extinction for 20 to 30 percent of all plant and animal species. The Kyoto Protocol committed most of the Annex I signatories to the UNFCCC (consisting of members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and several countries with “economies in transition”) to mandatory emission-reduction targets, which varied depending on the unique circumstances of each country. Other signatories to the UNFCCC and the protocol, consisting mostly of developing countries, were not required to restrict their emissions.

The movie is played so incredibly loud my wife fishes earplugs out of her purse. It begins as a rock’n’roll assault of sound and image as a gonzo climber races into the desert, biking and hiking, headphones cranked. But as he rushes to hit road,  a shelf cam dwells on the Swiss Army knife he forgets to pack. A telling moment.

There have been some great adventurer-in-peril movies, notably Touching the Void and and Into the Wild. But they had more to work with.

Context:  This results in much smaller, emulsified fat globules that don’t float to the top of the container to form a cream layer.  In addition to the fat micelles, there are also casein micelles.  These are much smaller globs that contain calcium phosphate (CaP) inside.  In an animal, these micelles are meant to carry the CaP to the infant’s stomach. [PAR] Our goal is to get the micelles interacting with each other so that they will coagulate and form a gel (the curds).  We can do this using one of the following methods. [PAR] Enzyme-Mediated Coagulation [PAR] This process involves the use of rennet, which is used to make most cheeses.  Rennet can be composed of one or more proteases, including pepsin, chymosin, and proteses derived from microbes such as Mucor miehei.  When they are added to the milk, they begin to break up the portions of the casein protein that sticks out of the micelle surface.  These portions of the protein are what keeps the the hydrophobic micelles floating around in the milk.  When they are removed, the micelles become incredibly unstable.  The only way for them to stabilize is to start interacting with each other, thereby reducing the amount of the micelle that is exposed to the rest of the milk.

2026-02-18 09:55:59 INFO     context:        This results in much smaller, emulsified fat globules that don’t float to the top of the container to form a cream layer.  In addition to the fat micelles, there are also casein micelles.  These are much smaller globs that contain calcium phosphate (CaP) inside.  In an animal, these micelles are meant to carry the CaP to the infant’s stomach. [PAR] Our goal is to get the micelles interacting with each other so that they will coagulate and form a gel (the curds).  We can do this using one of the following methods. [PAR] Enzyme-Mediated Coagulation [PAR] This process involves the use of rennet, which is used to make most cheeses.  Rennet can be composed of one or more proteases, including pepsin, chymosin, and proteses derived from microbes such as Mucor miehei.  When they are added to the milk, they begin to break up the portions of the casein protein that sticks out of the micelle surface.  These portions of the protein are what keeps the the hydrophobic micelles floating around in the milk.  When they are removed, the micelles become incredibly unstable.  The only way for them to stabilize is to start interacting with each other, thereby reducing the amount of the micelle that is exposed to the rest of the milk.  This forms a gel matrix “net” which traps all the very large fat globules floating around.  If properly done, the whey will be almost perfectly clear and all the curds will form a mass that floats at the top

Context: All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900.

2026-02-18 09:56:19 INFO     context:       All but a few of the most inert elements, such as noble gases and noble metals, are usually found on Earth in chemically combined form, as chemical compounds. While about 32 of the chemical elements occur on Earth in native uncombined forms, most of these occur as mixtures. For example, atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, and native solid elements occur in alloys, such as that of iron and nickel. [PAR] The history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like carbon, sulfur, copper and gold. Later civilizations extracted elemental copper, tin, lead and iron from their ores by smelting, using charcoal. Alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more, with almost all of the naturally-occurring elements becoming known by 1900.

Context: [PAR] In 1960, UEFA had a full-time staff of just three people. That figure has risen steadily through the years as the organisation has reacted to changing circumstances. Today, 574 permanent and fixed-term staff of 37 different nationalities (as of June 2016) – administrators, secretaries, lawyers, IT and media specialists, coaches, translators – are employed at UEFA's administrative headquarters located in the town of Nyon, on the shores of Lake Geneva in western Switzerland. The body has resided in Nyon since 1995 after beginning its life in Paris, before moving to the Swiss federal capital Berne, where UEFA stayed for over three decades from 1960. [PAR] Over the decades, UEFA has developed from a mainly administrative body into a dynamic sports organisation that is in tune with the vast requirements of modern-day football. UEFA is a sporting authority which does not have the powers of a government; it represents Europe's national football associations, and can only act in accordance with the wishes of these associations. [PAR] When UEFA was founded, the body comprised 31 national associations. The number of member associations rose gradually until the beginning of the 1990s, when political developments in eastern Europe and the fragmentation of the USSR led to a rapid growth in the number of new nation states, each with its own football association. Consequently, there are now 55 associations under UEFA's wing. [PAR] ©UEFA.com 1998-2015. All rights reserved. [PAR] Last updated: 14/06/16 15.1
