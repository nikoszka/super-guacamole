It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, which is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy, sunflower or sesame seeds. Some also may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are also a number of different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.   [PAR] Though the origins of bagels are somewhat obscure, it is known that they were widely consumed in eastern European Jewish communities from the 17th century. The first known mention of the bagel, in 1610, was in Jewish community ordinances in Kraków, Poland. [PAR] Bagels are now a popular bread product in North America, especially in cities with a large Jewish population, many with different ways of making bagels.

From these deposits beneath the town have been found Palaeolithic flint tools, including at least six Acheulian handaxes. Further flint tools made by hunter gatherers living in the Colne Valley during the Mesolithic have been discovered, including a tranchet axe from Middlewick.  In the 1980s an archaeological inventory showed that over 800 sherds of pottery from the Neolithic, Bronze Age and early Iron Age have been found within Colchester, along with many examples of worked flint. This included a pit found at Culver Street containing a ritually placed Neolithic grooved ware pot, as well as find spots containing later Deverel-Rimbury bucket urns. Colchester is surrounded by Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments that pre-date the town, including a Neolithic henge at Tendring, large Bronze Age barrow cemeteries at Dedham and Langham, and a larger example at Brightlingsea consisting of a cluster of 22 barrows.

According to custom, he carried both his father\\'s and mother\\'s last name; his earliest recordings were issued under the name D. Pérez Prado, but the \"D.\" was dropped on his American releases, and in 1955 he had his full name legally shortened to Pérez Prado. Starting in childhood, Prado studied classical piano, and by the time he finished school, he was good enough to play piano and organ professionally in local clubs and movie theaters. He moved to Havana around 1942 and freelanced for a number of smaller orchestras over the next year or so. Chiefly a pianist at this point, he also landed an arranging job with Gapar Roca de la Peer, which sometimes supplied material to the highly popular Orquesta Casino de la Playa. The orchestra\\'s lead vocalist, Cascarita, liked Prado\\'s work, and soon they hired him as arranger and pianist. This was the early platform Prado needed to develop his own arranging style, and after-hours jam sessions around Havana were already influencing his rhythmic concepts. Seeking to bring more excitement into the well-established rumba rhythm, Prado began to experiment with the hard swing of American jazz, influenced especially by the harmonically sophisticated big-band music of Stan Kenton. He also sought to build new Afro-Cuban-derived rhythms, including a pattern that was dubbed the mambo, whose early forms were traced back ',\n",

[PAR] HOW BOTULINUM TOXIN WORKS [PAR] Botox is very lethal and a small amount of the substance is enough to cause harm to humans. Botulinum toxin is made up of just two ordinary proteins joined together by easily broken chemical bonds—sulfur-to-sulfur bonds between cysteine amino acids in two proteins (Ingraham, p.234). The heavier protein is responsible for seeking and finding the exact spot where nerves contact muscles. When botulinum toxin arrives at this critical junction, a lighter protein that is a protein-destroying enzyme called protease attacks the neuromuscular junction. Consequently, when the neuromuscular junction is destroyed, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine cannot bind to it. Botox works by neuromuscular inhibition of acetylcholine. Without the intervention of acetylcholine, muscle contraction and wrinkles will take place.

The lower jaw, which extends further forward than the upper jaw, is equipped with four sensory pores on the underside. The dorsal and anal fins are set well back on the body. Chain pickerel are usually olive-green or yellowish-brown on the back and sides, shading to a creamy yellow underneath. There is a distinctive pattern of interlocking dark bands on the back and sides that is reminiscent of a chain-link fence. During their first year they may reach 12-14 inches in length. Growth slows somewhat during the second year when they may attain lengths of 1.5 feet. In Texas they typically reach sizes of 3-4 pounds and about 2 feet in length.

There is no parental care. When the young hatch they feed on plankton, aquatic insects or even their own siblings. At about three inches the diet becomes almost exclusively other fish.

They hired the Hells Angels, a motorcycle gang with a history of violence and involvement in a host of illegal activities, to provide security, allegedly in return for $500 worth of beer, though both parties deny this claim. [PAR] The concert was marked by violence from the start , as the Hells Angels used pool cues to control the crowd and protect the four-foot stage. During a performance by Jefferson Airplane, singer Marty Balin was knocked unconscious by an Angel who jumped onto the stage to break up a fight. The incident, as well as the general violence, convinced the Grateful Dead to cancel their performance. [PAR] The Rolling Stones took the stage in the evening, when the violence would turn deadly. Meredith Hunter, an African-American teenager, approached the stage armed with a knife and gun. Hells Angel Alan Passaro attacked Hunter , stabbing him several times with a knife as the Stones finished “Under My Thumb.” [PAR] The incident was captured on film by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, who created the concert documentary, “ Gimme Shelter .” The footage shows Hunter, at stage left, fighting with a group of Hells Angels and holding a gun; Passaro sees the gun from his position near center stage and attacks Hunter.

The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton's third law describes the transfer of energy for reaction turbines. [PAR] In the case of steam turbines, such as would be used for marine applications or for land-based electricity generation, a Parsons type reaction turbine would require approximately double the number of blade rows as a de Laval type impulse turbine, for the same degree of thermal energy conversion. Whilst this makes the Parsons turbine much longer and heavier, the overall efficiency of a reaction turbine is slightly higher than the equivalent impulse turbine for the same thermal energy conversion. [PAR] In practice, modern turbine designs use both reaction and impulse concepts to varying degrees whenever possible. Wind turbines use an airfoil to generate a reaction lift from the moving fluid and impart it to the rotor. Wind turbines also gain some energy from the impulse of the wind, by deflecting it at an angle. Turbines with multiple stages may utilize either reaction or impulse blading at high pressure. Steam turbines were traditionally more impulse but continue to move towards reaction designs similar to those used in gas turbines.

Copenhagen is situated on the eastern coast of Zealand and stretches across part of Amager. A number of bridges and tunnels connect the parts of the city together, and the cityscape is characterized by promenades and waterfronts. Originally a Viking fishing village founded in the 10th century, Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in the beginning of the 15th century. During the 17th century, under the reign of Christian IV, it became a significant regional centre. Since the turn of the millennium, Copenhagen has seen a strong urban and cultural development, partly due to massive investments in cultural facilities and infrastructure. Since the completion of the transnational Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish city of Malmö, growing into a combined metropolitan area, known as the Øresund Region. Copenhagen is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark and is among the financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen has 89,000 students enrolled in its educational institutions. [PAR] The Nuttall Encyclopedia(0.0',\n",

[PAR] Interesting Fact: Ares is considered to be similar to the Roman god Mars, but is generally thought to be more brutal and uncivilized. That may be just Roman conceit, however. Note the similarity between the names - Mars is basically Ares with an \"M\" attached. Another very ancient female deity related to Artemis, Martis, may have contributed to the naming of both Mars and Ares. And some see a connection between the aggressive Ram sign of the Zodiac, Aries.

This play has more intricate choreography than you’ll find in most musicals, with the complicated action keeping everyone on their toes (or falling down on other parts of their bodies). As our director Jeremy Herrin has put it, Michael’s stage directions for the play are simply “magisterial” – his is the guiding hand keeping all of the chaos in motion, making an incredibly complex map of interactions somehow seem effortless, uproarious, and even inevitable.

After its launch on November 28, 1964 and a journey of hundreds of millions of kilometers, Mariner 4 passed within 9844 kilometers of Mars on July 14, 1965. Beginning at a range of 16,900 km, the probe acquired a surface image composed of 200 lines, consisting of 200 pixels each (average resolution was about 3 km/pixel) every 48 seconds until, at a range of 11,900 km, 22 television pictures of the Martian surface had been stored on the spacecraft's 4-track tape recorder (the last 3 of these pictures were beyond the terminator). It took 4 days to transmit the image information to Earth and the spacecraft returned useful data until October 1965, when the distance from Earth and its antenna orientation temporarily halted the signal acquisition. Data acquisition resumed in late 1967 and continued until December 20, 1967. [PAR] Objectives [PAR] Mariner 4 was designed with 3 main objectives in mind.

[PAR] When at the ending of the 1800s a lot of Sicilians began to emigrate to the United States, \"men of honour\" created branches of the mafia there; but while in Sicily the mafia was still a rural and archaic organization, in the new country it perfectly adapted itself to the local background and grew up into a real criminal enterprise.

[PAR] Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery [PAR] Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy Surgery [PAR] Cholecystectomy: Removal of the Gallbladder [PAR] The gallbladder is a small organ that is part of the human digestive system. It secretes bile, an enzyme that breaks down fats in food. Sometimes the gallbladder cannot work effectively, and instead of breaking down fats it begins to form lumps known as gallstones. When this happens, removal of the gallbladder – known as a cholecystectomy – may be necessary. [PAR] Traditional vs. laparoscopic cholecystectomy [PAR] Traditional cholecystectomy involved making a major incision and dislodging the liver in order to remove the gall bladder. This procedure was risky and required several days in the hospital as well as more than a month of recovery time. [PAR] The modern alternative, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, was developed in 1989. This procedure involves the insertion of a camera in a tube through the navel. Several small incisions are made, and the surgeon, guided by the camera, uses tiny instruments to cut the ducts and arteries that hold the gallbladder inside the body. When performed correctly, laparoscopic cholecystectomy poses less risk to the patient’s liver, reduces hospital stays, and cuts recovery time to less than a month. ',\n",

Such disasters include natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes or asteroid collisions, accidents such as shipwrecks or airplane crashes, or calamities like worldwide disease pandemics. The films usually feature some degree of build-up, the disaster itself and sometimes the aftermath, usually from the point of view of specific individual characters or their families.  [PAR] These films often feature large casts of actors and multiple plotlines, focusing on the characters' attempts to avert, escape or cope with the disaster and its aftermath. The genre came to particular prominence during the 1970s with the release of high-profile films such as Airport (1970), followed in quick succession by The Poseidon Adventure (1972), Earthquake (1974) and The Towering Inferno (1974).  [PAR] The casts were generally made up of familiar character actors. Once the disaster begins in the film, the characters are usually confronted with human weaknesses, often falling in love and almost always finding a villain to blame. The genre experienced a renewal in the 1990s boosted by computer-generated imagery (CGI) and large studio budgets which allowed for more focus on the destruction, and less on the human drama, as seen in films like 1998's Armageddon and Deep Impact. \",\n",

Cremona was a town that had been renowned for its master violin makers for nearly 100 years. Its leading craftsman during Stradivari's early life was Niccolo Amati, who represented the third generation of his family to contribute to the development of the traditional violin style popular at that time. Stradivari was probably apprenticed to Amati by the early 1660s and under his direction learned the craft of violin making. [PAR] Experimented with Violin Design [PAR] By 1666, Stradivari was producing instruments independently as well as continuing to work at his mentor's shop, which he probably did until Amati's death in 1684. In 1667, he was married to Francesca Feraboschi and set up his own household and shop; the couple eventually had six children and two of their sons would follow in their father's footsteps as violin makers. In the decade or so before 1680, Stradivari created a wide variety of stringed instruments, including guitars, harps, lutes, and mandolins. He continued to follow Amati's basic design for violins, but during this time he began experimenting with improvements in tone and design. The small number of instruments he created were primarily sold in Cremona, and he was not well-known outside the city in these years. \",\n",

This day is a new moon day, and is the first day of the  first Chinese lunar month in the Chinese Lunar Calendar system. The exact new moon time is at 15:40 on  23-Jan-12 in China's time zone. [PAR] The Year 2012 is the 4709th Chinese year.  The Chinese believe that the first king of China was the Yellow King (he was not  the first emperor of China). The Yellow King became king in 2697 B.C., therefore  China will enter the 4709th year on January 23, 2012. Also, the Chinese Year  uses the cycle of 60 Stem-Branch counting systems and the Black Water Dragon is  the 29th Stem-Branch in the cycle. Since (60 *78) + 29 = 4709, therefore 2012 is  the Water Dragon year, which is the 4709th Chinese Year. [PAR] Some web sites say the year 2012 is the 4710th Chinese year. \",\n",

Gold is element 79 and its symbol is Au. Though the name is Anglo Saxon, gold originated from the Latin Aurum, or shining dawn, and previously from the Greek. It's abundance in the earth's crust is 0.004 ppm. [PAR] 100% of gold found naturally is isotope Au-197. 28 other isotopes can be produced artificially and are all radioactive. [PAR] Gold along with silver and copper, form a column in the periodic table. They are found naturally and were the first three elements known to man. They were all used as primitive money well before the first gold coins which appeared in Egypt around 3400 BC. [PAR] Most gold is ancient or comes from Central American Aztecs and South American Incas brought to Europe by the Spanish and Portuguese in the 16th century, and which has since been recycled over and over again. In 1830 world output was no more than 12 tonnes per annum. But around that time, new gold discoveries were being made. Finds were discovered in Siberia, California, New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, Transvaal, South Africa, the Klondike and Alaska, and they all produced gold rushes. World production was then around 150 tonnes per year. It is now around 2300 tones per annum. \",\n",

[PAR] O'Hare vs. Midway - The Great Chicago Airport Debate [PAR] An ongoing debate for travellers to our city and Chicago residents alike is which airport to use: O'Hare or Midway. Of course, if you're travelling to most international destinations, your choice would be O'Hare. Midway only handles domestic flights and select service to Toronto and a few Mexican locales. In a city such as Chicago that is unfortunately known for its weather-related flight delays, it's important to take all things into consideration before booking. [PAR] O'Hare [PAR] O'Hare is the second busiest airport in the country, behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. This means that there are more options for flight times, but also more foot traffic and it's more crowded. The consensus from many travellers is that you must arrive at O'Hare well before your scheduled flight in order to allow ample time for check-in. Usually about 90 minutes prior to a domestic departure and 2 hours before flying internationally. \",\n",

The electrons carry a negative electrostatic charge and under certain conditions can move from atom to atom. The direction of movement between atoms is random unless a force causes the electrons to move in one direction. This directional movement of electrons due to an electromotive force is what is known as electricity. [PAR] Electrical Conductivity [PAR] Electrical conductivity is a measure of how well a material accommodates the movement of an electric charge. It is the ratio of the current density to the electric field strength. Its SI derived unit is the Siemens per meter, but conductivity values are often reported as percent IACS. IACS is an acronym for International Annealed Copper Standard, which was established by the 1913 International Electrochemical Commission. (More Information on the IACS.) The conductivity of the annealed copper (5.8001 x 107S/m) is defined to be 100% IACS at 20Â°C . All other conductivity values are related back to this conductivity of annealed copper. Therefore, iron with a conductivity value of 1.04 x 107 S/m, has a conductivity of approximately 18% of that of annealed copper and this is reported as 18% IACS. ',\n",

Those films of his that I have seen are kinetic, dynamic, and leap from the screen.

All of this is true for Trainspotting, a film that managed to hold my attention tightly for its entire duration despite the fact that it will probably never join the ranks of my personal favorites. [PAR] By the very nature of its subject matter—namely, the lives and the relationships between a number of addicts—one would expect parts of Trainspotting to be unpleasant, but Boyle does not simply decorate his film with moments of grim reality. Instead, he allows grim reality to dominate every scene. While he does not wholly condemn his characters, Boyle doesn’t turn a blind eye to the consequences of their behavior either. Rather, he successfully manages to portray multiple horrors of crime and drug use without ever allowing his film to become melodramatic.

Aridity is not a matter of precipitation alone but is defined by the relationship between the precipitation input to the soil in which the plants grow and the evaporative losses. Since evaporation is difficult to evaluate and is not a conventional measurement at meteorological stations, Köppen was forced to substitute a formula that identifies aridity in terms of a temperature-precipitation index (that is, evaporation is assumed to be controlled by temperature). Dry climates are divided into arid (BW) and semiarid (BS) subtypes, and each may be differentiated further by adding a third code, h for warm and k for cold. [PAR] As noted above, temperature defines the other four major climate types. These are subdivided, with additional letters again used to designate the various subtypes. Type A climates (the warmest) are differentiated on the basis of the seasonality of precipitation: Af (no dry season), Am (short dry season), or Aw (winter dry season). Type E climates (the coldest) are conventionally separated into tundra (ET) and snow / ice climates (EF). The mid-latitude C and D climates are given a second letter, f (no dry season), w (winter dry), or s (summer dry), and a third symbol (a, b, c, or d [the last subclass exists only for D climates]), indicating the warmth of the summer or the coldness of the winter.

[PAR] Marsupials were once widespread over the earth, but were displaced in most regions as the more successful placental mammals evolved. The Australian region, which has been isolated from contact with other regions since the Cretaceous period, had almost no native placental mammals, and the marsupials were able to continue their evolution there without competition. They underwent an adaptive radiation in Australia comparable to that of placental mammals in the rest of the world, evolving many forms that superficially resemble various placental mammals and fill the same ecological niches.

It shares a border with Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi. The area now known as Louisiana was originally inhabited by Native Americans from at least 3400 BC. Europeans arrived in the area in the 16th century and by the 17th century the French had begun to colonize the area. The Spanish took most of the territory after the Seven Years War, but in 1800 it was purchased by Napoleon Bonaparte for France. After a failed military campaign in Haiti, Napoleon sold the Louisiana Territory to the United States. This territory was split up into the Territory of Orleans (modern day Louisiana) and the District of Louisiana.

He was an influential pre-Socratic philosopher and pupil of Leucippus, who formulated an atomic theory for the cosmos. [PAR] His exact contributions are difficult to disentangle from his mentor Leucippus, as they are often mentioned together in texts. Their speculation on atoms, taken from Leucippus, bears a passing and partial resemblance to the nineteenth-century understanding of atomic structure that has led some to regard Democritus as more of a scientist than other Greek philosophers; however their ideas rested on very different bases. Largely ignored in ancient Athens, Democritus was nevertheless well known to his fellow northern-born philosopher Aristotle. Plato is said to have disliked him so much that he wished all his books burned. Many consider Democritus to be the “father of modern science”. [PAR] We know that he wrote on Babylon and Meroe; he must also have visited Egypt, and Diodorus Siculus states that he lived there for five years. He himself declared that among his contemporaries none had made greater journeys, seen more countries, and met more scholars than himself.

This view spans an area of the specimen about 5 millimeters wide and high. Specimen and photo by Arkenstone / www.iRocks.com . [PAR] Where Does Malachite Form? [PAR] Malachite is a mineral that forms at shallow depths within the Earth, in the oxidizing zone above copper deposits. It precipitates from descending solutions in fractures, caverns, cavities, and the intergranular spaces of porous rock. It often forms within limestone where a subsurface chemical environment favorable for the formation of carbonate minerals can occur.  Associated minerals include azurite , bornite , calcite , chalcopyrite , copper , cuprite , and a variety of iron oxides. [PAR] Some of the first malachite deposits to be exploited were located in Egypt and Israel.  Over 4000 years ago, they were mined and used to produce copper.  Material from these deposits was also used to produce gemstones, sculptures, and pigments.  Several large deposits in the Ural Mountains of Russia were aggressively mined, and they supplied abundant gem and sculptural material in the 1800s.  Very little is produced from these deposits today.  Much of the  malachite entering the lapidary market today is from deposits in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Smaller amounts are produced in Australia, France, and Arizona. [PAR] Stalactitic malachite: A specimen of stalactitic malachite from the Kasompi Mine, Democratic Republic of the Congo. ',\n",

In 2012 Richard Noble claimed that the car was a representation of Thrust SSC and they didn’t have permission. [PAR] Nevertheless, the Bloodhound SSC is a British supersonic, pencil shaped vehicle with a jet engine and the intention to exceed 1000mph. The runway has been built in Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape, South Africa. It is 12 miles long by 2 miles wide and the record attempt is scheduled to take place in 2016. The 7.5 tonne vehicle has to be flown from Bristol to South Africa in order for the record to take place. Also following the rules, it would have to be turned over in order to make its second lap. It is estimated that it would only take the Bloodhound 55seconds to reach the speed of 1000mph.

The author provides a wealth of detailed information, spiced with anecdotes and pungent remarks from Stilwell\\'s diaries. Her analysis reveals how America\\'s romantic enchantment with China and the idealized, false image of Chiang Kai-shek\\'s regime as a democracy evolved, causing far-reaching consequences for America after 1945. Slightly more than half of the study is taken up by the period 1939 to 1945 when Stilwell was commander of the China-Burma-India theater until President Roosevelt gave in to Chiang\\'s persistent pressure and recalled Stilwell in late 1944. Mirroring the fact that America had no official relations with the Chinese Communists during Stilwell\\'s time (and perhaps also that it was still problematic to write about them in 1970), Tuchman\\'s book deals with the Chinese Communist movement only marginally.

Romney worked for the management consulting firm Bain & Company before founding the investment firm Bain Capital in 1984.  Romney became a national figure in 1999 when he took over as president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and helped rescue the 2002 Winter Olympics from money and ethical problems.

Maureen Cleave - \"We're More popular than Jesus Now\" - Beatles Interviews Database [PAR] John Lennon Interview: London Evening Standard, \"More Popular Than Jesus\" 3/4/1966 [PAR] QUICK MENU [PAR] ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW: [PAR] Reporter Maureen Cleave, a good friend of John Lennon's, wrote a personality article about him that would be published in the March 4th 1966 edition of the London Evening Standard. Cleave's piece was intended to present a portrait of the behind-the-scenes Lennon, and was entitled 'How Does A Beatle Live? John Lennon Lives Like This.' The article contained a number of Lennon musings, remarks and random thoughts from a recent conversation she had with him at his home in Weybridge, including John's personal view of the current state of religion:  \"Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now. I don't know which  will go first, rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\" [PAR] A separate article with different content, including portions of the Jesus quote out of context from the original \n",
